Právě hledáme Specialistu distribučního centra do našeho nového distribučního centra ve Stéblové. Co u nás budete dělat? Na našem distribučním centru pracujete jak fyzicky, tak u počítače. Postaráte se o správu léčiv. To znamená, že pohlídáte druh, spotřebu i množství léčiv. Dohlídnete i na skladovací podmínky léčiv, které jsou citlivé na teploty. Když přijede zboží, fyzicky ho přijmete a naskladníte. Kolegům z distribuce zase naopak přichystaná léčiva fyzicky vydáte. Pohlídáte si, že systémově vše sedí a potřebné dokumenty jsou v pořádku připravené (práce je hodně i o administrativě). Budete mít na starost i kontrolu, sanitaci a kompletní úklid skladovacích prostor. Pracovat budete pouze od pondělí do pátku na dvousměnný provoz (ranní 6:00-14:30, odpolední 9:30-18:00). Co je u nás nejlepší? Volné víkendy u nás máte jisté! Budete se u nás cítit dobře. Jsme přátelští a každému nováčkovi rádi pomůžeme. Čas od času se navíc všichni sejdeme na nějaké firemní akci. Těšit se můžete na bonusy k základní mzdě, stravenky, týden dovolené navíc nebo na benefitní program Cafeterie a Multisport kartu. Všichni zaměstnanci Avenieru i jejich rodinní příslušníci mají očkování zdarma anebo se slevou. Dostanete firemní mobilní telefon a přispějeme vám také na penzijní a životní pojištění. Nebudete jen ""jeden z mnoha zaměstnanců"" - budete součástí skvělého týmu lidí. Jestli splňujete následující požadavky, těšíme se na vás! S počítačem a MS Office si dobře rozumíte (práce je hodně i o administrativě). Jste pečliví, protože správa skladu léčiv je důležitá a zodpovědná práce. Víte, co obnáší práce ve skladu a nebojíte se ani fyzické práce. Logické myšlení je vám blízké, umíte pracovat samostatně a je na vás spoleh. Bydlíte v okolí obce Stéblová? Pozice je pak pro vás jako dělaná! Výhodou je i zkušenost se skladovým hospodářstvím a systémem Navision. Není to však nutné. Můžete nastoupit ihned? Ozvěte se nám a získejte práci, která vás nebude nudit!","Distribution Center Specialist Stéblová Added 3 days ago Answer you get within 2 weeks Specialist Distribution Center Stéblová Salary Neušeen Answer you get the answer within 2 weeks: Avenier a.s.
