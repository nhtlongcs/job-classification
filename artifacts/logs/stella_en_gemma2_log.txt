**Parts Coordinator** Job Advertisement

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Parts Coordinator" suggests a role focused on managing and coordinating parts for a specific industry, likely manufacturing or engineering. The description mentions SAP experience, data entry, and working with engineering drawings, aligning with technical and administrative tasks.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The ad highlights responsibilities like maintaining item master databases, releasing parts, interrogating SAP for information, and supporting parts author teams. These tasks involve data management, inventory control, and communication with technical teams.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad emphasizes SAP experience, data entry skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. These skills point towards a role requiring both technical proficiency and strong organizational abilities.

4. **ISCO Unit Analysis:**

    * **2141 (Industrial and Production Engineers):** While the role involves working with engineering drawings and supporting engineers, the focus on data management, inventory control, and SAP expertise leans more towards a coordination and administrative function rather than design or production engineering.

    * **3115 (Mechanical Engineering Technicians):** This unit focuses on technical tasks assisting mechanical engineers. While the Parts Coordinator might interact with engineers, their primary role is not directly involved in technical design or implementation.

    * **3122 (Manufacturing Supervisors):** This unit involves supervising production staff and ensuring smooth operations. The Parts Coordinator role lacks supervisory responsibilities and focuses more on data management and coordination.

    * **3151 (Ships' Engineers):** This unit is irrelevant to the job advertisement as it focuses on marine engineering and ship operations.

    * **7222 (Toolmakers and Related Workers):** This unit involves skilled tradespeople who create and repair tools. The Parts Coordinator role is not hands-on and does not involve toolmaking.

    * **7231 (Motor Vehicle Mechanics and Repairers):** This unit focuses on repairing and maintaining vehicles. The Parts Coordinator role is not directly involved in vehicle repair.

    * **7232 (Aircraft Engine Mechanics and Repairers):** This unit focuses on repairing and maintaining aircraft engines. The Parts Coordinator role is not directly involved in aircraft maintenance.

    * **8211 (Mechanical Machinery Assemblers):** This unit involves assembling mechanical components. The Parts Coordinator role is not involved in physical assembly.

    * **8219 (Assemblers Not Elsewhere Classified):** This unit involves assembling various products but does not align with the data management and coordination focus of the Parts Coordinator role.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 2141**
**ISCO Title: Industrial and Production Engineers**
**Confidence: 0.4**
**Reasoning:** While not a perfect match, the Parts Coordinator role shares some similarities with Industrial and Production Engineers, particularly in terms of working with engineering drawings and supporting engineering teams. However, the emphasis on data management and coordination suggests a more administrative function.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 3115, 4211, 4212**

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **3115 (Mechanical Engineering Technicians):** This unit is a closer match than the others, as the Parts Coordinator interacts with technical information and supports engineering teams.

* **4211 (Secretaries and Personal Assistants):** This unit reflects the administrative and organizational aspects of the role, including data entry, communication, and scheduling.

* **4212 (Receptionists and Information Clerks):** This unit captures the communication and information management aspects of the role, particularly if the Parts Coordinator interacts with internal and external stakeholders.

    * **Major Group 5: Services And Sales Workers:** This is a clear fit as the job involves direct customer service and sales.
    * **Sub-major Group 52: Sales Workers:** This further narrows down the focus to sales-related roles.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the job title, description, responsibilities, and required skills, the job advertisement most closely aligns with the ISCO unit for **Shop sales assistants (5223)**. While the role involves cashier duties, the emphasis on sales, customer service, and product knowledge suggests a primary focus on assisting customers with their purchases.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 5223
ISCO Title: Shop sales assistants
Confidence: 0.85
Reasoning: The job description strongly emphasizes sales and customer service, aligning with the core responsibilities of a shop sales assistant. While cashier duties are mentioned, they appear to be a secondary aspect of the role.

**Activities Coordinator**

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**

The job title "Activities Coordinator" suggests a role focused on planning and organizing activities for a specific group of people. The job description mentions working with elderly/dementia residents in a care home setting.

**Step 2: Comparing with ISCO Units**

Let's compare the job ad with the provided ISCO units:

* **1341: Child care service managers:** This unit focuses on managing childcare services for children, not elderly individuals. This is not a suitable match.
* **1343: Sports, recreation and cultural centre managers:** This unit involves managing recreational facilities and activities for a broader audience, not specifically elderly residents in a care home. This is not a suitable match.
* **3122: Manufacturing supervisors:** This unit involves supervising manufacturing processes and workers, which is completely unrelated to the job description. This is not a suitable match.
* **3333: Employment agents and contractors:** This unit involves matching job seekers with employers, which is not relevant to the job ad. This is not a suitable match.
* **3341: Office supervisors:** This unit involves supervising clerical workers, which is not relevant to the job ad. This is not a suitable match.
* **3423: Fitness and recreation instructors and programme leaders:** This unit involves leading fitness and recreational activities, which partially aligns with the job description. However, the focus on elderly residents with dementia suggests a more specialized approach than general fitness instruction.
* **5162: Companions and valets:** This unit involves providing companionship and personal assistance, which is partially relevant to the job description. However, the emphasis on organizing activities suggests a more active role than simply providing companionship.
* **5322: Home-based personal care workers:** This unit involves providing personal care and assistance to individuals in their homes. While some aspects of this unit may overlap with the job description, the focus on organizing activities suggests a broader role.

**Step 3: Determining the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit**

Based on the analysis, none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match the job description. However, **3423: Fitness and recreation instructors and programme leaders** seems to be the closest match due to the emphasis on organizing and leading activities.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 3423**
**ISCO Title: Fitness and recreation instructors and programme leaders**
**Confidence: 0.6**
**Reasoning:** The job involves planning and leading activities for a specific group (elderly/dementia residents), which aligns with the core responsibilities of this ISCO unit. However, the specialized context of a care home setting and the focus on individuals with dementia suggest a more specialized role than typical fitness instructors.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 5322, 3412, 2423**

**Reasoning for Alternatives:**

* **5322: Home-based personal care workers:** This unit captures the element of providing care and support to elderly individuals.

**Step 2: Comparing with ISCO Units**

* **1114: Managing Directors and Chief Executives:** This unit focuses on high-level strategic management, which doesn't seem to align with the specific regulatory focus described in the job ad.

* **1120: Managing Directors and Chief Executives:** Similar to 1114, this unit is too broad and doesn't specifically address the regulatory aspect.

* **1212: Human Resource Managers:** This unit deals with personnel management, which is not the primary focus of the job ad.

* **1219: Business Services and Administration Managers (Other):** This unit is too general and doesn't capture the specialized nature of regulatory affairs.

**ISCO Title: Health Services Managers**
**Confidence: 0.8**
**Reasoning:** The job ad's focus on regulatory compliance for healthcare products, particularly ATIMPs, strongly suggests a role within the health services sector.

4. **ISCO Unit Analysis:**

    * **3141 Life science technicians (excluding medical):** While this unit involves laboratory work, it often focuses on biological and life science research, which is not explicitly mentioned in the job ad.

    * **3142 Agricultural technicians:** This unit is less relevant as it focuses on agricultural research and practices, which are not mentioned in the job description.

    * **7315 Glass makers, cutters, grinders and finishers:** This unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**Content Operations Intern (6 month FTC) - London**

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Content Operations Intern" suggests a role focused on managing and supporting the operational aspects of content creation and distribution. This aligns with the descriptions of several ISCO units, particularly those related to web and multimedia development, marketing, and customer service.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad highlights tasks such as:
    * Publishing new voucher codes
    * Selecting the best sales and deals
    * Moderating content submitted by users

These skills are relevant to roles involving content management, customer interaction, and administrative tasks.

4. **ISCO Unit Analysis:**

    * **2431 - Advertising and marketing professionals:** This unit seems more relevant, as the role involves selecting deals and promoting them to users. However, the focus on content moderation and administrative tasks suggests a less strategic and more operational role.

    * **4222 - Contact centre information clerks:** This unit focuses on providing information and handling customer inquiries, which aligns with the content moderation and customer service aspects of the role. However, the emphasis on content curation and deal selection suggests a broader scope than simply answering customer questions.

    * **5223 - Shop sales assistants:** This unit is less relevant, as the role doesn't involve direct sales interactions with customers in a physical store setting.

    * **5244 - Contact centre salespersons:** This unit is also less relevant, as the role doesn't involve actively selling products or services over the phone.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 4222**
**ISCO Title: Contact centre information clerks**
**Confidence: 0.7**
**Reasoning:** The role involves a combination of content moderation, customer service, and administrative tasks, which aligns with the responsibilities of a contact centre information clerk. While the role may have a broader scope than simply answering customer inquiries, the emphasis on providing information and supporting customers through online channels makes this unit the most suitable.

    * **1324 (Supply, Distribution and Related Managers):** While this unit involves some financial aspects, the emphasis on supply chain and logistics doesn't fully match the job description.

**Spanish Team Leader**

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Spanish Team Leader" suggests a supervisory role within a team focused on content moderation, likely for a social media platform. This aligns with the descriptions of ISCO units 1114 (Managing Directors and Chief Executives) and 1323 (Information and Communications Technology Service Managers).

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad mentions responsibilities like:
    * Assisting the Manager in meeting site metrics and goals.
    * Supervising a team of up to 20 moderators.
    * Providing mentorship, guidance, and career development to the team.
    * Monitoring queues for variations and making adjustments.
    * Implementing escalation channels.
    * Communicating team strategy effectively.

These tasks are more aligned with team leadership and operational management than high-level strategic decision-making typical of Managing Directors.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad emphasizes problem-solving, critical thinking, analytical, and technical capabilities. While these are valuable for ICT Service Managers, the focus on team supervision and operational tasks points towards a more hands-on leadership role.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **1323 (Information and Communications Technology Service Managers):** This unit is a closer fit, as it involves managing ICT resources and teams. However, the emphasis on content moderation and team leadership suggests a more specialized role.

**Conclusion:**

While the job ad shares some similarities with both ISCO units, **1323 (Information and Communications Technology Service Managers)** is a more appropriate fit due to the focus on managing a team of moderators and ensuring the smooth operation of a content moderation system.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 1323

**Job Advertisement:** Kokapstrādes operators (apmaksāta prakse) | VisiDarbi.lv

**Translation:** Woodworking operator (paid practice) | VisiDarbi.lv

**Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Kokapstrādes operators" translates to "Woodworking operator," which aligns with several ISCO units related to woodworking. The description mentions "apmaksāta prakse," meaning "paid practice," suggesting an apprenticeship or training role.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad lacks specific details about responsibilities and tasks. We can infer that the role involves operating woodworking machinery and potentially assisting experienced woodworkers.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad doesn't specify required skills or qualifications, further indicating a potential entry-level or training position.

4. **ISCO Units:**

    * **ISCO Code (unit): 7523**
    * **ISCO Title: Woodworking machine tool setters and operators**
    * **Relevance:** This unit seems most relevant due to the "Woodworking operator" title. However, the lack of detail about specific machinery and the mention of "paid practice" suggest a less experienced role than a fully qualified setter and operator.

    * **ISCO Code (unit): 7522**
    * **ISCO Title: Cabinet-makers and related workers**
    * **Relevance:** This unit is less likely as it focuses on more specialized woodworking tasks like furniture making, while the job ad seems more general.

    * **ISCO Code (unit): 7521**
    * **ISCO Title: Wood treaters**
    * **Relevance:** This unit is unlikely as it focuses on treating and preserving wood, not operating machinery for shaping or processing it.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 7523**
**ISCO Title: Woodworking machine tool setters and operators**
**Confidence: 0.6**
**Reasoning:** While the job ad lacks specifics, the title "Woodworking operator" strongly suggests this unit. The "paid practice" aspect lowers the confidence as it implies a less experienced role than a fully qualified setter and operator.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad mentions "full and ongoing training," implying that the role is entry-level and requires on-the-job learning. This aligns with the technician-level ISCO unit 3522.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **2153 (Telecommunications engineers):** This unit focuses on designing, developing, and overseeing telecommunications systems. While the trainee role may eventually involve these aspects, the emphasis on installation and fault resolution suggests a more hands-on, technician-level position.

    * **3522 (Telecommunications engineering technicians):** This unit aligns more closely with the job description, focusing on technical tasks related to telecommunications equipment installation, maintenance, and repair.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 3522**
**ISCO Title: Telecommunications engineering technicians**
**Confidence: 0.8**
**Reasoning:** The job description emphasizes hands-on installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of telecommunications services, aligning closely with the tasks and responsibilities of a telecommunications engineering technician. The "trainee" aspect suggests an entry-level position within this field.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 7422, 3113**

**Explanation:**

* **7422 (Information and communications technology (ICT) installers and servicers):** This unit is a broader category encompassing various ICT-related installation and maintenance roles. While it overlaps with the job description, 3522 is more specific to telecommunications.

* **3113 (Electrical engineering technicians):** This unit focuses on electrical engineering, which may overlap with some aspects of telecommunications. However, the emphasis on telecommunications services and equipment in the job ad makes 3522 a more suitable choice.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Job Title and Description:**

* The job title is "comercial inmobiliario" which translates to "real estate commercial" in English.
* The description mentions "Real Estate Commercial Agency Technocasa Costa de la Luz Huelva, Huelva Province" indicating a focus on real estate sales.

**2. Main Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* The ad mentions "represent[ing] companies in selling a range of industrial, medical and pharmaceutical goods and services to industrial, business, professional and other establishments." This aligns with the tasks described in ISCO unit 2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals).
* It also mentions "fixed salary + commissions" which is typical for sales roles.

**3. Required Skills and Qualifications:**

* The ad states "Experience is not necessary, since it is in charge of the company." This suggests the company is willing to train, which is common for entry-level sales positions.

**4. Major, Sub-Major, and Minor Groups:**

* ISCO unit 2433 falls under Major Group 2 (Professionals), Sub-Major Group 24 (Business and Administration Professionals), and Minor Group 243 (Sales and Marketing Professionals). This aligns with the nature of the job.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the job title, description, responsibilities, and required skills, ISCO unit 2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals) appears to be the most appropriate fit. While the ad doesn't explicitly mention "technical" goods, the focus on representing companies and selling to businesses suggests a sales role requiring product knowledge and client relationship skills, which are characteristic of this unit.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2433
* **ISCO Title:** Technical and medical sales professionals
* **Confidence:** 0.8
* **Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities outlined in ISCO unit 2433. The focus on selling to businesses and the mention of commissions further support this classification.

Response:


**Data Engineer**

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Data Engineer" aligns with several ISCO units, particularly those related to database and network professionals (2521, 2529) and software developers (2512).

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad emphasizes tasks like ETL/ELT processes, data migrations, experience with Hadoop and Spark, and knowledge of RDBMS/NoSQL databases. These responsibilities strongly suggest a role in data management and processing, aligning with ISCO units 2521 and 2529.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad mentions "SQL, Python or Java or Scala," indicating programming skills essential for data engineering. The requirement for "experience in data migrations" further supports the data management focus.

4. **Major, Sub-Major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **Major Group 2:** Professionals - This is a strong match as the job requires specialized knowledge and skills.
    * **Sub-Major Group 25:** Information and Communications Technology Professionals - This aligns perfectly with the job's focus on data technologies and software.
    * **Minor Group 252:** Database and Network Professionals - This seems most relevant given the emphasis on data management, ETL processes, and database technologies.

**Analysis of Potential ISCO Units:**

* **ISCO Code (unit): 2521**
    * **ISCO Title:** Database designers and administrators
    * **Relevance:** This unit is a strong match due to the focus on database architecture, data structures, and management tasks mentioned in the job ad.

* **ISCO Code (unit): 2529**
    * **ISCO Title:** Database and network professionals not elsewhere classified
    * **Relevance:** This unit is also relevant as it encompasses data professionals who may not fit neatly into other categories. The job ad's mention of "experience with Agile methodologies" and "excellent communication skills" suggests a broader role beyond purely database administration.

* **ISCO Code (unit): 2512**
    * **ISCO Title:** Software developers
    * **Relevance:** While the job involves programming skills, the primary focus on data management and processing makes this unit less suitable than 2521 or 2529.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 2521**
**ISCO Title:** Database designers and administrators
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Reasoning:** The job ad strongly emphasizes database-related tasks, including ETL processes, data migrations, and knowledge of various database technologies. While the role may involve some software development aspects, the core responsibilities align more closely with database design and administration.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 2529, 2512, 2149**

The provided job advertisement describes a role focused on supporting the development and implementation of a digital roadmap for a non-profit organization. The role involves collaborating with users and stakeholders, understanding organizational outcomes, and contributing to the transformation of the organization's digital proposition.

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **Information and communications technology service managers (ISCO Code: 1330):**

    * **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Digital Product Officer" aligns somewhat with the responsibilities of an ICT service manager, but the focus on product development and user experience leans more towards a specialized role within ICT rather than overall management.

    * **Responsibilities and Tasks:** While the job involves understanding user needs and contributing to digital strategy, it doesn't explicitly mention managing ICT teams, budgets, or infrastructure, which are core responsibilities of ICT service managers.

    * **Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement mentions experience with web projects and understanding of UX, which are relevant to ICT, but not necessarily indicative of managerial experience.

    * **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** This unit falls under Major Group 1 (Managers), Sub-major Group 13 (Production and Specialized Services Managers), which seems partially relevant.

2. **Product and garment designers (ISCO Code: 2163):**

3. **Graphic and multimedia designers (ISCO Code: 2166):**

    * **Job Title and Description:** This unit is more relevant than the previous one, as it involves designing visual content for digital platforms. However, the job advertisement emphasizes strategic thinking, user research, and product development, which go beyond purely visual design.

4. **Web technicians (ISCO Code: 3514):**

    * **Job Title and Description:** This unit focuses on maintaining and supporting existing websites, which is not the primary focus of the job advertisement. The role described is more about shaping the future digital strategy and product development.

5. **Personnel clerks (ISCO Code: 4416):**

    * **Job Title and Description:** This unit is completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

**Final Prediction:**

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ISCO unit is not a perfect match. However, considering the focus on digital product development, user experience, and strategic thinking, the closest fit is:

**ISCO Code (unit): 2166**
**ISCO Title: Graphic and multimedia designers**
**Confidence: 0.6**
**Reasoning:** While the role involves more than just visual design, the emphasis on user experience and digital product development aligns with the broader scope of graphic and multimedia designers who often contribute to the design and functionality of digital products.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 2513, 1330, 2163**

**Explanation:**

* **2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals):** This unit is a strong alternative as it encompasses web development and multimedia design, which are relevant to the job.

* **1330 (Information and communications technology service managers):** This unit remains a possibility if the role evolves to include more managerial responsibilities.

Strategic Partnership Managers

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**

The job title "Strategic Partnership Managers" suggests a role focused on building and managing relationships with external stakeholders. The job description emphasizes collaboration, negotiation, communication, and community engagement.

**Step 2: Comparing with ISCO Units**

Let's analyze the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance:

* **1120: Managing Directors and Chief Executives:** This unit focuses on high-level strategic decision-making and overall management of organizations. While the Strategic Partnership Manager role involves some strategic thinking, it doesn't seem to encompass the full scope of responsibilities associated with a Managing Director or CEO.

* **1213: Policy and Planning Managers:** This unit involves developing and implementing policies and strategic plans. While the Strategic Partnership Manager role involves some planning and strategy development, it's more focused on building and managing relationships than on overarching policy creation.

* **1219: Business Services and Administration Managers:** This unit covers a broad range of managerial roles in business services. While some aspects of the Strategic Partnership Manager role might overlap with this unit, the emphasis on external stakeholder management and community engagement suggests a more specialized focus.

* **1324: Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Service Managers:** This unit focuses on managing ICT systems and services. This is clearly not relevant to the Strategic Partnership Manager role.

* **1343: Aged Care Service Managers:** This unit focuses on managing aged care facilities and services. This is not relevant to the Strategic Partnership Manager role.

* **1420: Systems Analysts:** This unit focuses on analyzing and designing information systems. This is not relevant to the Strategic Partnership Manager role.

**Step 3: Determining the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit**

Based on the analysis, none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match the Strategic Partnership Manager role.

**Alternative ISCO Units (descending relevance):**

1. **1213: Policy and Planning Managers:** This unit is the closest match due to the strategic planning and stakeholder engagement aspects of the role.

2. **1219: Business Services and Administration Managers:** This unit captures some of the managerial responsibilities involved, but lacks the specific focus on external partnerships.

3. **1323: Construction Managers:** This unit is a stretch, but the emphasis on building relationships and managing complex projects could be loosely related.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 1213**
**ISCO Title: Policy and Planning Managers**
**Confidence: 0.6**
**Reasoning:** While not a perfect match, this unit best reflects the strategic planning and stakeholder engagement aspects of the Strategic Partnership Manager role.

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **Database designers and administrators (2521):**

    * **Reasoning:** While the job involves maintaining servers and applications, the focus is not on designing or developing databases. The responsibilities are more aligned with system administration and support.

2. **Systems administrators (2522):**

    * **Reasoning:** This unit seems more fitting. The job description emphasizes maintaining operational integrity, carrying out system checks, and ensuring service levels are met. These tasks align with the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

3. **Computer network professionals not classified elsewhere (2529):**

    * **Reasoning:** This unit is less likely as the job description doesn't explicitly mention network design, implementation, or security, which are key aspects of this unit.

4. **Information and communications technology operations technicians (3511):**

    * **Reasoning:** This unit focuses on the day-to-day operation and monitoring of ICT systems. While some aspects overlap with the job description, the emphasis on system administration and support makes 2522 a better fit.

5. **Information and communications technology user support technicians (3512):**

    * **Reasoning:** This unit focuses on providing technical assistance to users. The job description doesn't mention user support as a primary responsibility.

6. **Computer network and systems technicians (3513):**

    * **Reasoning:** This unit is less relevant as the job description doesn't focus on network installation, maintenance, or troubleshooting.

    * **Reasoning:** This unit is not applicable as the job description doesn't mention website development or maintenance.

8. **Information and communications technology (ICT) installers and servicers (3522):**

    * **Reasoning:** This unit focuses on installing and repairing ICT equipment. The job description doesn't mention these tasks.

**Final Prediction:**

Security Engineer Job Advertisement

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**

The job title "Security Engineer" immediately suggests a focus on information security, aligning with several ISCO units related to ICT security.

**Step 2: Comparing Job Description with ISCO Units**

* **ISCO 2529 (ICT Security Specialists):** This unit seems highly relevant. The job description mentions "identify problems and anomalies and trigger necessary corrective actions," "Document the configurations and organize and maintain the manuals for installation, operation and use of the various systems," and "Provide second-line support to the various teams of information systems in diagnosing and solving problems," all tasks consistent with an ICT security specialist role.

* **ISCO 1330 (Systems Analysts):** While the job involves analyzing systems and identifying problems, the primary focus on security measures and configurations makes this unit less suitable than 2529.

* **ISCO 2522 (Systems Administrators):** This unit focuses on maintaining and administering computer systems, which overlaps with some aspects of the job description (e.g., "Management and configuration of firewall products"). However, the emphasis on security and problem-solving points more towards 2529.

* **ISCO 3513 (Computer Network and Systems Technicians):** This unit is less relevant as it primarily focuses on network establishment and maintenance, while the job description emphasizes security aspects.

* **ISCO 3512 (ICT User Support Technicians):** This unit is not a good fit as it focuses on providing technical assistance to users, which is not the primary responsibility of the Security Engineer role.

* **ISCO 3514 (Web Technicians):** This unit is irrelevant as it focuses on website maintenance and management, which is not mentioned in the job description.

* **ISCO 3155 (Air Traffic Safety Electronics Technicians):** This unit is completely unrelated to the job description.

**Step 3: Skill and Qualification Analysis**

The required skills and qualifications (experience with firewall technologies, Microsoft and Linux OS, 2nd line support experience, Active Directory management) further support the relevance of ISCO 2529.

**Step 4: Final Prediction**

Based on the job title, description, responsibilities, and required skills, the most appropriate ISCO unit is:

**ISCO Code (unit): 2529**
**ISCO Title: ICT Security Specialists**
**Confidence: 0.9**
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of an ICT Security Specialist, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security measures, and providing support related to security issues.

Records Management Adviser

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**

The job title "Records Management Adviser" suggests a role focused on advising and implementing strategies for managing records, both physical and digital. This aligns with the descriptions of several ISCO units, particularly those related to information management and database administration.

**Step 2: Comparing with ISCO Units**

Let's analyze each provided ISCO unit:

* **2423 - Systems Analysts:** This unit focuses on analyzing and designing computer systems. While the job ad mentions "digital records management," the emphasis is on advising and organizing, not designing systems. This unit seems less relevant.

* **2511 - Database Designers and Administrators:** This unit involves designing, developing, and maintaining databases. While the Records Management Adviser might deal with databases, their primary role is broader, encompassing all types of records, not just digital ones.

* **2529 - Database and Network Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified:** This unit is a catch-all for IT professionals not fitting other categories. While it's possible, the job ad's focus on records management and advising suggests a more specialized role.

* **2621 - Archivists and Curators:** This unit involves preserving and managing historical and cultural artifacts. While there might be some overlap in skills, the Records Management Adviser's focus on active records management within an organization is distinct from archival work.

* **3341 - General Office Clerks:** This unit involves routine clerical tasks. The Records Management Adviser's role requires specialized knowledge and skills in records management, making this unit unsuitable.

* **4110 - General and Keyboard Clerks:** Similar to 3341, this unit focuses on basic clerical tasks and lacks the specialized nature of the Records Management Adviser role.

* **4312 - Statistical, Finance and Insurance Clerks:** This unit involves processing financial and statistical data. While the Records Management Adviser might handle some data related to records, their primary focus is on managing the records themselves, not analyzing financial information.

* **4416 - Personnel Clerks:** This unit involves maintaining personnel records. While there might be some overlap in record-keeping skills, the Records Management Adviser's role is broader and encompasses all types of records, not just personnel-related ones.

**Step 3: Determining the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit**

Based on the analysis, none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match the job advertisement. However, **2529 - Database and Network Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified** seems the closest fit due to its broad scope and inclusion of professionals working with data and information systems.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 2529
ISCO Title: Database and Network Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified
Confidence: 0.6
Reasoning: While not a perfect match, this unit encompasses professionals working with data and information systems, which aligns with the Records Management Adviser's focus on managing both physical and digital records.

**Job Advertisement:**

US International Trade Associate, 2-7PQE - Washington D.C.

Our client's Washington office is looking for an International Trade attorney with experience in export controls including classification, licensing, and compliance regimes, and economic sanctions. EAR, ITAR, and OFAC regulations experience preferred. This is an exciting opportunity to join a progressive national law firm and work closely with global market-leading partners. US qualified Attorneys need only apply. If this would be something of interest, then please get in touch with **** **********. Jameson Legal acts as an employment business for temporary recruitment and as an employment agency for fixed term contract and permanent recruitment.

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "US International Trade Associate" suggests a legal professional specializing in international trade law. Comparing this to the provided related job titles, "Lawyer" (2611) seems the most relevant.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad emphasizes experience in export controls, licensing, compliance regimes, and economic sanctions. This aligns with the tasks described for "Lawyer" (2611), which includes advising clients on legal matters, drafting legal documents, and representing clients in legal proceedings.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires a US qualified attorney with 2-7 years of experience (PQE). This further supports the "Lawyer" (2611) classification, as it requires a law degree and legal practice experience.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

* **Major Group 2:** Professionals. This is appropriate as the role requires specialized legal knowledge and skills.
* **Sub-major Group 26:** Legal, Social, and Cultural Professionals. This aligns with the legal nature of the job.
* **ISCO Unit 2611:** Lawyers. This unit specifically describes professionals who give legal advice, draft legal documents, and represent clients in legal matters, which perfectly matches the job description.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 2611**
**ISCO Title: Lawyers**
**Confidence: 0.95**
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly describes a legal professional specializing in international trade law, requiring a US qualified attorney with relevant experience. The responsibilities and tasks align perfectly with the definition and tasks of the "Lawyer" ISCO unit.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**

* 2433: Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT) - This unit could be considered if the role involved more client-facing sales and marketing activities related to international trade law services. However, the emphasis on legal expertise and experience makes "Lawyer" a more accurate fit.
* 3342: Legal secretaries - This unit is less relevant as it focuses on administrative and support tasks for legal professionals, while the job ad seeks a qualified attorney with independent legal responsibilities.
* 3411: Legal and related associate professionals - This unit could be considered if the role involved more paralegal or support functions, but the requirement for a US qualified attorney with PQE suggests a more senior and independent legal role.

**Maintenance Assistant**

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Maintenance Assistant" aligns with several ISCO units, particularly those related to building maintenance and repair. The description emphasizes general maintenance tasks, including Legionella testing, plumbing, electrical work, and general repairs.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad lists a variety of tasks, including:
    * Legionella testing and monitoring
    * Taking water temperatures
    * DNV checks (likely referring to building safety inspections)
    * Maintaining electrical beds
    * Assisting maintenance engineers
    * Filter cleans in AC units
    * Replacing broken sinks
    * Automatic door tests
    * Unblocking sinks and toilets
    * Changing light bulbs
    * Ensuring fixtures and fittings are in good working order
    * Rewiring and changing fuses
    * Clearing or cleaning general areas
    * Moving and assembling furniture or equipment

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad mentions experience as a building maintenance assistant/handyperson, M&E knowledge, basic plumbing knowledge, and an enhanced DBS check.

4. **ISCO Unit Analysis:**

    * **3112 - Civil engineering technicians:** While this unit involves building-related tasks, the focus is on design, construction, and operation, not primarily on general maintenance and repair. The job ad's emphasis on hands-on repairs and less on technical design makes this unit less suitable.

    * **3113 - Electrical engineering technicians:** This unit focuses on electrical systems design, installation, and maintenance. While the job ad mentions electrical work, it's not the primary focus, and the tasks are more general maintenance-oriented.

    * **3114 - Electronics engineering technicians:** This unit is not relevant as the job ad doesn't involve electronics-specific tasks.

    * **3115 - Mechanical engineering technicians:** This unit involves mechanical systems design, installation, and maintenance. While some tasks in the job ad might overlap, the focus on general building maintenance and repairs makes this unit less suitable.

    * **5153 - Building caretakers:** This unit focuses on cleaning, basic repairs, and building upkeep. While some tasks align, the job ad emphasizes more technical repairs and maintenance, including electrical and plumbing work, making this unit less precise.

    * **7411 - Building and related electricians:** This unit is a strong contender as it involves installing, maintaining, and repairing electrical wiring systems and related equipment. The job ad mentions electrical work, but it's not the sole focus, and other tasks like plumbing and general repairs are also significant.

    * **7412 - Electrical mechanics and fitters:** This unit is also relevant as it involves fitting, adjusting, installing, and repairing electrical machinery and equipment. However, the job ad mentions a broader range of tasks beyond just electrical work, including plumbing and general maintenance.

    * **9622 - Odd-job persons:** This unit involves cleaning, painting, and simple repairs. While some tasks align, the job ad requires more specialized skills and knowledge, including electrical and plumbing work.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 7411**
**ISCO Title: Building and related electricians**
**Confidence: 0.7**
**Reasoning:** While the job ad encompasses a range of maintenance tasks, the emphasis on electrical work, combined with other building-related repairs, aligns most closely with the responsibilities of a Building and related electrician.

**Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Auxiliary worker-Crovant" and the description mention "Auxiliary worker-coach" and "support worker-corner." These terms suggest a manual labor role involving physical tasks and potentially some level of support or assistance.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The ad mentions "permanent work," "full full time," and "5d. In a week," indicating a full-time, permanent position. The tasks are not explicitly stated but implied to be related to loading and unloading, as "Crovant" likely refers to loading/unloading.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad doesn't specify any particular skills or qualifications, suggesting that the role may be entry-level and require basic physical capabilities.

4. **ISCO Units:**

    * **2423 Personnel and careers professionals:** This unit is not relevant as the job description clearly indicates a manual labor role, not a professional or administrative one.
    * **3333 Employment agents and contractors:** This unit is also not relevant as the job ad is for a direct employment position, not a recruitment or agency role.
    * **3341 Office supervisors:** This unit is not applicable as the job description does not involve supervising other workers.
    * **3342 Legal secretaries:** This unit is irrelevant as the job description does not involve legal work or secretarial duties.
    * **4416 Personnel clerks:** This unit is not relevant as the job description does not involve administrative tasks related to personnel records.
    * **5321 Health care assistants:** This unit is not applicable as the job description does not involve providing healthcare or personal care.
    * **5322 Home-based personal care workers:** This unit is not relevant as the job description does not involve providing care in a home setting.
    * **5329 Other personal care workers:** This unit is not applicable as the job description does not involve providing personal care services.
    * **9111 Domestic cleaners and helpers:** This unit is not relevant as the job description does not involve cleaning or domestic duties.
    * **9211 Crop farm labourers:** This unit is not relevant as the job description does not involve agricultural work.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the job title, description, and implied tasks, the most appropriate ISCO unit appears to be **9621 Labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport**.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 9621
ISCO Title: Labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport
Confidence: 0.8
Reasoning: The job description strongly suggests a manual labor role involving loading and unloading, which aligns with the tasks typically performed by labourers in various industries.

The description emphasizes tasks like travel arrangements, document formatting, meeting coordination, and general administrative support.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad highlights responsibilities like:
    * **Travel arrangements:** This suggests a level of complexity beyond basic clerical tasks, potentially involving international travel coordination and risk assessments.
    * **Document formatting and preparation:** This points towards strong computer skills and familiarity with specific software (e.g., MS Office Suite).
    * **Meeting coordination and scheduling:** This indicates organizational and communication skills.
    * **General administrative support:** This encompasses a broad range of tasks, including answering inquiries, managing correspondence, and maintaining records.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad mentions the need for:

    * **Strong communication and interpersonal skills:** These are crucial for interacting with colleagues, clients, and external stakeholders.
    * **Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite:** This is a standard requirement for most administrative roles.

4. **ISCO Unit Analysis:**

    * **1219 - Administrative and Executive Secretaries:** This unit seems like a strong initial match. The job description aligns with many of the tasks and responsibilities outlined for this unit. However, the emphasis on travel arrangements and risk assessments might suggest a more specialized role.

    * **3341 - Office Supervisors:** This unit focuses on supervising clerical staff. While the job ad mentions coordinating with colleagues, it doesn't explicitly state supervisory responsibilities.

    * **3342 - Legal Secretaries:** This unit is not a good fit as the job description doesn't mention any legal-specific tasks or knowledge.

    * **3343 - Administrative and Executive Secretaries:** This unit is a closer match than 3341, but the travel arrangements and risk assessments might still be too specialized.

    * **3344 - Medical Secretaries:** This unit is not relevant as the job description doesn't involve healthcare-related tasks.

    * **4110 - General Office Clerks:** This unit is too broad and doesn't capture the complexity and specialized nature of the tasks described in the job ad.

    * **4222 - Contact Centre Information Clerks:** This unit is not relevant as the job description doesn't involve handling customer inquiries or phone-based interactions.

    * **4225 - Inquiry Clerks:** This unit is not a good fit as the job description doesn't focus on responding to inquiries or providing information to the public.

    * **4312 - Statistical, Finance and Insurance Clerks:** This unit is not relevant as the job description doesn't involve financial or statistical data processing.

    * **4416 - Personnel Clerks:** This unit is not a good fit as the job description doesn't mention managing personnel records or recruitment processes.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 1219**
**ISCO Title: Administrative and Executive Secretaries**
**Confidence: 0.75**
**Reasoning:** While the job ad emphasizes travel arrangements and risk assessments, which might suggest a more specialized role, the core responsibilities align closely with the tasks and duties of an Administrative and Executive Secretary.

The job ad describes a Maths Teacher position at Nottingham Academy – Greenwood Road Campus. The responsibilities include teaching Maths to pupils of all ages and abilities, leading effective teaching and learning, inspiring students to achieve outstanding progress, and driving standards and raising achievement.

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **2310 - University and higher education teachers:** This unit is not a good fit because the job ad specifically mentions teaching pupils of all ages and abilities, indicating a primary or secondary school setting rather than a university or higher education institution.

2. **2320 - Vocational education teachers:** This unit is also not a good fit because the job ad does not mention teaching vocational or occupational subjects intended to prepare students for specific occupations.

3. **2330 - Secondary education teachers:** This unit seems like a strong potential match. The job ad mentions teaching Maths to pupils of all ages and abilities, which aligns with the scope of secondary education.

4. **2341 - Primary school teachers:** This unit is less likely because the job ad mentions teaching pupils of "all ages and abilities," suggesting a broader range than typically found in primary schools.

5. **2351 - Education methods specialists:** This unit is not a good fit because the job ad focuses on direct teaching responsibilities rather than curriculum development, research, or advising on teaching methods.

6. **2352 - Special needs teachers:** This unit is not a good fit because the job ad does not mention specializing in teaching students with special needs.

7. **2353 - Other language teachers:** This unit is not relevant as the job ad focuses on teaching Maths, not a foreign language.

Response:


Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Job Title and Description:**

* The job title is "Lecturer in English (GCSE and Functional Skills) and ESOL." This suggests a teaching role focused on English language and literacy skills.
* The description mentions teaching GCSE and Functional Skills English, indicating a focus on secondary education level and adult education. It also mentions ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages), broadening the scope to include adult learners with diverse language backgrounds.

**2. Main Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* The advertisement highlights responsibilities like:
    * Planning and delivering lessons in English (GCSE, Functional Skills, ESOL)
    * Assessing student progress
    * Potentially coordinating with other departments across campuses

**3. Required Skills and Qualifications:**

* The ad mentions qualifications related to teaching English, likely requiring a teaching certification or relevant degree.

**4. ISCO Unit Analysis:**

* **2310: University and higher education teachers:** This unit focuses on teaching at the university level, which doesn't align with the job ad's emphasis on GCSE, Functional Skills, and ESOL, typically taught at secondary or adult education levels.
* **2320: Vocational education teachers:** While this unit involves teaching practical skills, the focus on English language and literacy doesn't fit the vocational education context.
* **2330: Secondary education teachers:** This unit seems most relevant. The job ad's focus on GCSE and Functional Skills aligns with secondary education. However, the inclusion of ESOL, often taught in adult education settings, complicates the fit.
* **2341: Primary school teachers:** This unit is not suitable as the job ad explicitly mentions GCSE and Functional Skills, which are beyond the primary school level.
* **2351: Education methods specialists:** This unit focuses on curriculum development and research, not direct classroom teaching, which is the primary focus of the job ad.
* **2352: Special needs teachers:** This unit is not relevant as the job ad doesn't mention specializing in teaching students with special needs.
* **2353: Other language teachers:** While ESOL is a language, the ad also mentions teaching GCSE and Functional Skills English, suggesting a broader scope than just teaching a foreign language.
* **2355: Other arts teachers:** This unit is irrelevant as the job ad focuses on English language and literacy, not arts subjects.
* **2359: Teaching professionals not elsewhere classified:** This unit might be a potential fit due to the combination of secondary education (GCSE, Functional Skills) and adult education (ESOL).

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit): 2330**
* **ISCO Title: Secondary education teachers**
* **Confidence: 0.7**
* **Reasoning:** The job ad primarily focuses on teaching English at the secondary education level (GCSE and Functional Skills). While the inclusion of ESOL suggests some adult education involvement, the core responsibilities align more closely with secondary education.

Response:


Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

* The description mentions tasks like "Mounting work, welding, painting, machining of production lines," suggesting a role involving mechanical assembly, fabrication, and repair.

**2. Main Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* The ad highlights tasks like "Mounting work, welding, painting, machining of production lines," indicating a hands-on role involving mechanical assembly, fabrication, and repair.

    * **Reasoning:** This unit seems like a good fit because it encompasses tasks like repairing, installing, and maintaining machinery, which aligns with the job description. The mention of "machining of production lines" also points towards industrial machinery.

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 7222**
    * **ISCO Title:** Toolmakers and related workers
    * **Reasoning:** While the job description mentions "machining," it doesn't explicitly state the creation of tools. This unit focuses on toolmaking, which might be too specialized for this role.

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 7233**
    * **ISCO Title:** Agricultural and industrial machinery mechanics and repairers
    * **Reasoning:** This unit is very similar to 7223, but it focuses more on agricultural machinery. While the job ad doesn't specify agricultural machinery, it's possible.

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 8211**
    * **ISCO Title:** Mechanical machinery assemblers
    * **Reasoning:** This unit focuses on assembling mechanical machinery, which is a part of the job description. However, the ad also mentions repair and maintenance, which are more prominent in the other ISCO units.

    * **ISCO Title:** Electrical and electronic equipment assemblers
    * **Reasoning:** This unit is less relevant as the job description doesn't mention electrical or electronic assembly.

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 8219**
    * **ISCO Title:** Assemblers not elsewhere classified
    * **Reasoning:** This unit is too broad and doesn't capture the specific mechanical skills and experience implied in the job ad.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 7223**
* **ISCO Title:** Agricultural and industrial machinery mechanics and repairers
* **Confidence:** 0.8
* **Reasoning:** This unit best aligns with the job description's emphasis on mechanical assembly, repair, and maintenance of machinery. The mention of "machining of production lines" further supports this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 7233, 8211, 7222

Response:


**Vehicle Inspector & Quality Control**

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Vehicle Inspector & Quality Control" suggests a role focused on inspecting vehicles for quality and ensuring they meet standards. This aligns with the descriptions of ISCO units 7231 (Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers) and 7543 (Mechanical machinery assemblers).

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad emphasizes tasks like:
    * Consistently achieving quality and quantity vehicle inspections
    * Producing detailed reports and providing information to service and preparation teams
    * Supporting preparation teams and movement of inspected vehicles
    * Ensuring Key Storage process is followed

These tasks are more aligned with inspection and quality control rather than hands-on repair or assembly.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad mentions:
    * Great organizational skills
    * Ability to prioritize and work independently
    * Parts/vehicle knowledge
    * Driving license

These skills are relevant to inspection and quality control roles, not necessarily mechanical repair or assembly.

4. **Major, Sub-Major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **7231 (Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers):** While this unit involves working on vehicles, the focus is on repair and maintenance, not primarily inspection and quality control.
    * **7543 (Mechanical machinery assemblers):** This unit focuses on assembling mechanical components, which is not the primary function described in the job ad.
    * **5245 (Service station attendants):** This unit involves tasks like fueling, cleaning, and minor repairs, which are not the main focus of the job ad.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement is:

**ISCO Code (unit): 7515**
**ISCO Title: Food and beverage tasters and graders**
**Confidence: 0.6**
**Reasoning:** While none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match the job description, 7515 comes closest. The job involves inspecting, tasting, and grading vehicles for quality, which aligns with the core tasks of this unit. However, the lack of direct reference to "tasting" or "grading" in the traditional sense lowers the confidence level.

KOKK-GRILLMEISTER

Chef-grillmaster Tallink Grupp AS more information on the job offer and application HERE

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:**

The job title "KOKK-GRILLMEISTER" translates to "Chef-grillmaster" indicating a role focused on grilling and potentially other cooking tasks. This aligns with the descriptions of "Chef" (3434) and "Cook" (5120).

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:**

The description mentions "Chef-grillmaster" suggesting responsibilities beyond simple food preparation. It implies a level of culinary skill and experience.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:**

The advertisement doesn't explicitly list skills or qualifications. However, the title suggests a higher level of expertise than a typical "Fast food preparer" (9411) or "Kitchen helper" (9412).

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

* **3434 (Chef):** This unit seems highly relevant due to the "Chef-grillmaster" title. Chefs design menus, create dishes, and oversee food preparation.

* **5120 (Cook):** This unit is also relevant, as cooks plan, organize, prepare, and cook meals. However, the "Chef" title suggests a higher level of responsibility.

* **9411 (Fast food preparer) and 9412 (Kitchen helper):** These units are less relevant as they involve simpler tasks and less autonomy than implied by the job title.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the job title, the implied responsibilities, and the lack of information suggesting a lower-level role, the most appropriate ISCO unit appears to be **3434 (Chef)**.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 3434
ISCO Title: Chefs
Confidence: 0.8
Reasoning: The job title "Chef-grillmaster" strongly suggests a role involving menu creation, dish development, and overseeing food preparation, aligning with the responsibilities of a Chef.

**Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "DIÁKMUNKA - MARKETING ASSZISZTENCIA" translates to "STUDENT WORK - MARKETING ASSISTANCE". This aligns with the descriptions of several ISCO units, particularly those related to marketing and sales support.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job advertisement lists various tasks, including:
    * Translation of professional texts (English-Hungarian and vice versa)
    * Creating blog articles
    * Managing social media presence and advertisements
    * Image editing
    * Administrative tasks related to trade and marketing
    * Creating newsletters and presentations

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement specifies:
    * Intermediate English language skills
    * Good formulation and spelling skills
    * Flexibility and good cooperation
    * Minimum 6 hours of work per day

These requirements align with the skills needed for a marketing assistant role.

4. **ISCO Units:**

    * **2431 Advertising and marketing professionals:** This unit seems like a good fit initially, as it encompasses professionals involved in developing and coordinating advertising strategies and campaigns. However, the job description emphasizes more on execution and support tasks rather than strategic planning.

    * **2433 Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT):** This unit is not relevant as the job description does not involve selling goods or services directly to clients.

    * **5244 Contact centre salespersons:** This unit is also not relevant as the job description does not mention contacting potential customers via telephone or electronic communication for sales purposes.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement is **2431 Advertising and marketing professionals**. While the role focuses more on execution and support tasks, it still falls under the broader scope of marketing and advertising activities.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 2431
ISCO Title: Advertising and marketing professionals
Confidence: 0.7
Reasoning: The job description aligns with the tasks and responsibilities typically associated with marketing professionals, although the focus is more on execution and support rather than strategic planning.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Electrical Mate / Improver" suggests a skilled trade role rather than an engineering or design position. This eliminates options 2151 and 3113.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad mentions tasks like installing conduit, tray work, and trunking, which are typical for electricians working on construction or maintenance projects. This aligns well with the descriptions of 7411, 7412, and potentially 7413.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires a valid CSCS/ECS card, indicating a need for industry-recognized qualifications common for electricians.

4. **Major, Sub-Major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **2151, 3113:** These fall under "Professionals" which doesn't fit the hands-on nature of the job.
    * **7411, 7412, 7413:** These are all within "Craft and Related Trades Workers," aligning with the job's practical focus.
    * **7421:** This is also a "Craft and Related Trades Worker" but focuses on electronics, which isn't emphasized in the ad.
    * **8212:** This falls under "Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers," which doesn't match the description of installing electrical systems.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ISCO unit is:

**ISCO Code (unit): 7411**
**ISCO Title: Building and related electricians**
**Confidence: 0.8**
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of a building and related electrician, focusing on installation and maintenance of electrical systems in a construction context.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad emphasizes sourcing, interviewing, and managing the candidate journey for retail recruitment. This aligns with the tasks described in ISCO unit 2423, which includes advising on personnel functions relating to recruitment and selection.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad mentions seeking an "innovative and experienced Talent Acquisition Coordinator" who can think outside the box and build relationships. This suggests a higher level of skill and experience than a typical personnel clerk (4416), pointing towards ISCO unit 2423.

4. **Major, Sub-Major, and Minor Groups:**

    - ISCO unit 2423 (Personnel and careers professionals) falls under Major Group 2 (Professionals) and Sub-Major Group 24 (Business and Administration Professionals). This aligns with the professional nature of the role.

    - ISCO unit 4416 (Personnel clerks) falls under Major Group 4 (Clerical Support Workers) and Sub-Major Group 44 (Other Clerical Support Workers). This is less suitable given the emphasis on strategic sourcing and relationship building.

**ISCO Title: Personnel and careers professionals**
**Confidence: 0.8**
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of a Personnel and careers professional, particularly in the area of recruitment and selection. The required skills and experience also suggest a professional-level role rather than a clerical one.

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Supply Teachers" aligns with the descriptions of "Other teaching professionals" (ISCO 2359) and "Secondary education teachers" (ISCO 2330) and "Primary school teachers" (ISCO 2341).

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad emphasizes covering daily/short-term absences, marking work, providing feedback, and being flexible. These tasks align with the responsibilities of a substitute or supply teacher.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires Qualified Teacher Status/PGCE, DBS check, and experience in primary or secondary schools. These are standard requirements for qualified teachers.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **Major Group 2: Professionals:** This is appropriate as the role requires specialized knowledge and skills.
    * **Sub-major Group 23: Teaching Professionals:** This is a strong match as the core function is teaching.
    * **ISCO 2359: Teachers’ aides:** While the job involves assisting, the ad clearly states the need for qualified teachers, not assistants.

    * **ISCO 2330: Secondary education teachers:** This is a potential match as the ad mentions secondary school experience.

    * **ISCO 2341: Primary school teachers:** This is also a potential match as the ad mentions primary school experience.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the job title, responsibilities, required qualifications, and the need for qualified teachers, the most appropriate ISCO unit is:

**ISCO Code (unit): 2330**
**ISCO Title: Secondary education teachers**
**Confidence: 0.7**

Technical Support Scientist

**Step 1: Initial Assessment**

The job title "Technical Support Scientist" suggests a role requiring scientific knowledge and technical expertise to provide support within a scientific field. The job description emphasizes troubleshooting, problem-solving, and continuous improvement within the context of antigen production.

**Step 2: Comparing with ISCO Units**

Let's analyze the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance:

* **2113: Chemists:** This unit focuses on research, development, and application of chemical principles. While the job involves some chemical aspects (antigen production), the primary focus is on technical support and problem-solving rather than independent research.

* **2131: Biologists, Botanists, Zoologists and Related Professionals:** This unit is a closer fit as it encompasses professionals studying living organisms. However, the job description doesn't explicitly mention biological research or fieldwork, which are typical for this unit.

* **2145: Chemical Engineers:** This unit focuses on designing and developing chemical processes and equipment. While the job involves some understanding of chemical processes, the emphasis is on providing technical support rather than designing new processes.

* **3111: Chemical and Physical Science Technicians:** This unit covers technicians assisting scientists in various fields, including chemistry and physics. This seems more aligned with the job description, as the role involves providing technical support and performing tests.

* **3115: Mechanical Engineering Technicians:** This unit focuses on assisting mechanical engineers. This is not relevant to the job description, which doesn't involve mechanical engineering tasks.

* **3116: Chemical Engineering Technicians:** This unit is similar to 3111 but specifically focuses on chemical engineering. While relevant to some aspects of the job, it doesn't fully capture the broader technical support role.

* **3119: Physical and Engineering Science Technicians (not elsewhere classified):** This unit is a catch-all for technicians not fitting other categories. While it could potentially apply, it's less specific than 3111.

* **3141: Life Science Technicians (excluding medical):** This unit focuses on technicians supporting life science research. While antigen production involves biological elements, the job description emphasizes technical support rather than research.

The job title "Sous Chef/Acting Head Chef" suggests a role in a kitchen environment with responsibilities related to food preparation and management.

**Step 2: Comparing with ISCO Units**

* **3434 - Chefs:** This unit seems highly relevant as it describes professionals who design menus, create dishes, and oversee kitchen operations. The job ad mentions "righting new menu," "creating your dishes," and "looking after the stock/GP," which aligns with the tasks of a chef.

* **1412 - Restaurant managers:** This unit focuses on managing the overall operations of a restaurant, including staff supervision, customer service, and financial aspects. While the job ad mentions "looking after the stock/GP," it doesn't heavily emphasize customer service or staff management.

* **5152 - Domestic housekeepers:** This unit is clearly not relevant as it focuses on domestic duties in private households.

Let's analyze the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance:

* **1211: Finance managers:** This unit focuses on planning, directing, and coordinating financial operations. While the job ad mentions financial tasks, it's not the primary focus. The emphasis on administrative and operational duties suggests a broader scope than pure finance management.

* **1219: Business services and administration managers n.e.c.:** This unit covers managers responsible for various administrative and business services. This seems more aligned with the job description, encompassing tasks like managing online platforms, organizing events, and general office administration.

* **3332: Conference and event planners:** This unit focuses on organizing conferences and events. While the job ad mentions event organization, it's only one aspect of the role, and the broader administrative responsibilities suggest a more general office management position.

* **3341: Administrative and executive secretaries:** This unit focuses on providing secretarial and administrative support to managers. While some tasks overlap, the job ad emphasizes a more managerial role with responsibility for website management, event organization, and financial tasks.

* **3343: Administrative and executive secretaries:** This unit focuses on providing secretarial and administrative support to managers. While some tasks overlap, the job ad emphasizes a more managerial role with responsibility for website management, event organization, and financial tasks.

* **3344: Medical secretaries:** This unit focuses on administrative tasks within healthcare settings. This is clearly not relevant to the job ad.

* **3514: Web technicians:** This unit focuses on maintaining and supporting websites. While the job ad mentions website management, it's not the sole focus, and the broader administrative responsibilities suggest a more general office management role.

* **4416: Personnel clerks:** This unit focuses on maintaining personnel records. This is not relevant to the job ad.

**Step 3: Determining the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit**

Based on the analysis, **1219: Business services and administration managers n.e.c.** appears to be the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Title:** Business services and administration managers n.e.c.
* **Confidence:** 0.8
* **Reasoning:** The job description encompasses a wide range of administrative and operational tasks, including financial administration, website and social media management, event organization, and general office support.

**ISCO Unit Analysis:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Affiliate Marketers" suggests a role focused on driving traffic and generating leads for a website. The description emphasizes acquiring "successful leads" who register and earn money through the Notik platform.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The primary responsibility is to generate 250 successful leads per week. This involves promoting the Notik website and its offer wall to potential users in specific countries.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement doesn't explicitly list required skills, but it implies a need for marketing and lead generation expertise, potentially including online advertising, social media marketing, or email marketing.

4. **ISCO Unit Comparison:**

    * **1221 - Sales and Marketing Managers:** This unit focuses on managing sales and marketing activities, which is not the primary focus of the advertisement. While affiliate marketers may contribute to overall marketing strategies, their role is more tactical and focused on lead generation.

    * **2433 - Technical and Medical Sales Professionals (excluding ICT):** This unit involves selling technical or medical products and services. The advertisement doesn't mention selling any products, only driving traffic and leads to a website.

**ISCO Code (unit): 3322**
**ISCO Title: Commercial Sales Representatives**
**Confidence: 0.4**
**Reasoning:** Although the advertisement doesn't explicitly mention selling products, affiliate marketers are essentially driving sales by encouraging users to sign up and engage with the Notik platform. This aligns somewhat with the responsibilities of a commercial sales representative.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 1221, 2431, 3333**

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **1221 - Sales and Marketing Managers:** This unit is a broader category that could encompass affiliate marketing as part of a larger marketing strategy.

* **2431 - Advertising and Marketing Professionals:** This unit focuses on developing and executing marketing campaigns, which aligns with the strategic aspect of affiliate marketing.

* **3333 - Employment Agents and Contractors:** This unit involves matching job seekers with employers, which could be loosely related to the role of an affiliate marketer connecting users with the Notik platform.

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title "Kitchen Assistant" aligns closely with the descriptions of "Kitchen helpers" (9412) and "Cooks" (5120) but leans more towards the helper role due to the emphasis on assisting chefs.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad highlights tasks like assisting chefs with food preparation, keeping the kitchen clean, and understanding dietary requirements. These tasks are typical of a Kitchen helper (9412) rather than a Cook (5120) who has more responsibility for independent food preparation.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

    * **5120: Cooks:** This unit focuses on individuals who independently prepare and cook food. While the Kitchen Assistant assists chefs, they don't have the same level of responsibility.
