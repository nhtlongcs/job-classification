Response:
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided job advertisement and ISCO units:

**1. Translation & Initial Observations:**

* **Job Advertisement (Translated):**
    * **Title:** Medical Visitor - Peloponnese & Ionian Islands
    * **Description:** Medical group seeks medical visitor with previous experience as a medical visitor, based in Patras.  Area of employment Peloponnese and Ionian Islands. [To send your CV, click here.]

* **Observations:** The advertisement is brief. Key terms suggest a role focused on **client interaction** ("Medical Visitor") within a **pharmaceutical/healthcare** context ("Medical Group").  

**2. ISCO Unit Analysis:**

We will analyze each ISCO unit in the order provided, comparing for relevance:

* **2131 - Biologists, Botanists, Zoologists and Related Professionals:** This unit focuses heavily on scientific research and analysis of living organisms. There is no direct link to client interaction or the pharmaceutical industry in the core description. **Verdict: Not a match.**

* **2211 - Generalist Medical Practitioners:** This unit describes doctors who diagnose and treat patients directly. While the advertisement mentions a "Medical Group," a "Medical Visitor" role does not align with the hands-on medical practice described. **Verdict: Not a match.**

* **2212 - Specialist Medical Practitioners:** Similar to 2211, this unit focuses on direct patient care, but with specialized expertise. Again, the "Medical Visitor" role does not align. **Verdict: Not a match.**

* **2240 - Paramedical Practitioners:** This unit describes healthcare professionals providing services under medical doctor supervision. The advertisement lacks information about the Medical Visitor's level of autonomy or required qualifications, making it difficult to assess a match. **Verdict: Potentially relevant, but more information is needed.**

* **2250 - Veterinarians:** This unit is clearly focused on animal care and is not relevant to the advertisement. **Verdict: Not a match.**

* **2269 - Health Professionals (Other):** This unit is a catch-all for health professionals not fitting other categories. While potentially relevant, the lack of detail in the advertisement makes it difficult to confirm a match. **Verdict: Potentially relevant, but more information is needed.**

* **3256 - Medical Assistants:** This unit describes assistants working directly under medical professionals. The advertisement does not suggest a subordinate role or direct patient care duties. **Verdict: Not a match.**

* **3259 - Health Associate Professionals (Other):** Similar to 2269, this is a broad category.  The advertisement lacks detail to confirm if the Medical Visitor role aligns with the counselling and support services often described in this unit. **Verdict: Potentially relevant, but more information is needed.**

## ISCO Code Prediction for "Summer Trainee, Offering Management"

**Step 1: Analyze the Job Title and Description:**

* The job title "Summer Trainee, Offering Management" suggests an entry-level, temporary position within a department responsible for managing product or service offerings. 
* This does not immediately align with any of the provided ISCO job titles, which focus on established roles like managers, trainers, or clerks.

**Step 2: Identify Missing Information:**

* The job advertisement description is incomplete. We lack crucial information about:
    * **Main responsibilities and tasks:** What will the trainee be doing within Offering Management? 
    * **Required skills and qualifications:** What knowledge, skills, and experience are they seeking in a candidate?

**Step 3: Evaluate Potential ISCO Units based on Limited Information:**

* **1212 (Business Services and Administration Managers):**  While "Offering Management" could fall under business services, the trainee role likely lacks the managerial autonomy described in this unit.
* **1219 (Sales and Marketing Managers):**  Offering Management might be involved in sales and marketing, but again, a trainee role wouldn't have the managerial responsibilities outlined.
* **1221 (Supply, Distribution and Related Managers):** This unit focuses on logistics and physical goods, which might not be relevant to all types of "offerings."
* **1324 (Information and Communications Technology Services Managers):**  If the "offerings" are technology-related, this unit could be a possibility, but it's too early to tell without more information.
* **2356 (Information Technology Trainers):**  Unlikely, as the focus here is on training others, not managing offerings.
* **2424 (Training and Staff Development Professionals):**  Same reasoning as above; training is not the primary focus of the advertised role.
* **2431 (Advertising and Marketing Professionals):**  This unit is more closely aligned with marketing specific products or services, which could be relevant depending on the nature of the "offerings."
* **4323 (Transport Clerks):**  Highly unlikely, as this unit deals with logistics and transportation, not offering management.
* **5112 (Transport Conductors):**  Completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

**Step 4: Conclusion and Alternative Predictions:**

Due to the incomplete job advertisement, it is impossible to confidently assign an ISCO code. We need more information about the trainee's responsibilities and required skills. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (based on possible interpretations of "Offering Management"):**

* **3334 (Product Promoters):**  If the role involves supporting the promotion and marketing of offerings, this could be a fit.
* **4221 (Customer Service Clerks):** If the trainee interacts with customers regarding offerings, this unit might be relevant.
* **3341 (Market Research Interviewers):**  If the role involves gathering market data related to offerings, this could be a possibility.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code:**  N/A (Insufficient Information)
**ISCO Title:** N/A
**Confidence:** 0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement lacks sufficient information about responsibilities and required skills to accurately determine the ISCO code. 
**Alternative ISCO Codes:** 3334, 4221, 3341

## Job Advertisement Analysis:

**Title:**  RENKAME NAUJĄ KOMANDĄ DARBUI GAMYBOJE! ATLYGINIMAS KAS SAVAITĘ!
**Description:** RENKAME NAUJĄ KOMANDĄ DARBUI GAMYBOJE! ATLYGINIMAS KAS SAVAITĘ!

**English Translation:**  WE ARE RECRUITING A NEW TEAM TO WORK IN PRODUCTION! WEEKLY SALARY!
**Description:** WE ARE RECRUITING A NEW TEAM TO WORK IN PRODUCTION! WEEKLY SALARY!

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Insufficient Information:** The job advertisement provides very limited information, mentioning only "work in production" and "weekly salary."  There are no details about responsibilities, tasks, required skills, or qualifications.

2. **ISCO Unit Analysis:** Due to the lack of information, it is impossible to confidently assign an ISCO code based on the provided options.  Let's analyze why each provided unit is not a good fit:

    * **110 - Commissioned Armed Forces Officers:** Completely irrelevant, as the ad mentions "production," implying a civilian job.
    * **210 - Non-commissioned Armed Forces Officers:**  Also irrelevant for the same reasons as above.
    * **310 - Armed Forces Occupations, Other Ranks:**  Again, irrelevant due to the "production" context.
    * **4212 - Bookmakers and Croupiers and Related Gaming Workers:** No relation to the advertisement's content.
    * **5413 - Prison Guards:**  No connection to the job ad.
    * **7542 - Shotfirers and Blasters:**  Highly unlikely, as the ad lacks any mention of mining, quarrying, or demolition.
    * **8312 - Railway Brakers, Signallers and Shunters:** No relation to the advertised position.
    * **8350 - Ship’s Deck Crews and Related Workers:**  Irrelevant, as the ad implies a land-based production environment.
    * **9214 - Garden and Horticultural Labourers:**  No connection to the job ad.
    * **9622 - Odd-job Persons:**  While "production work" could be very broad, this unit typically refers to maintenance and repair tasks, not industrial production.

3. **Alternative ISCO Units:**  Given the limited information, here are three potentially relevant ISCO units:

    * **9331 - Assemblers:** This unit encompasses workers involved in assembling parts and products in various industries, making it a plausible match for a "production" environment.
    * **8211 - Metal Forming, Welding and Related Machine Operators:** If the production work involves metalworking, this unit could be a good fit.
    * **8121 - Food Processing and Related Trades Workers:**  Depending on the nature of the production facility, this unit might be relevant. 

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):**  Cannot be determined.
**ISCO Title:**  Cannot be determined.
**Confidence:** 0 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement lacks sufficient information to confidently assign an ISCO code. The vague description of "work in production" does not allow for a clear understanding of the job's responsibilities, required skills, or industry.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 9331, 8211, 8121

Job Ad ID: 818346622, Row: 25, Pred: 2211, 2212, 2269, 2240, 2230, 2261, 2250, 3259, 2267, 3256
Response:
The job advertisement only provides the job title "ārsts" and the website name "VisiDarbi.lv". 

1. **Translation:** "ārsts" translates to "doctor" in English. "VisiDarbi.lv" appears to be a Latvian job board website.

2. **Lack of Information:**  We have no information about the responsibilities, required skills, qualifications, or level of expertise for this doctor position. 

3. **Potential ISCO Units:**  Based on the limited information, the most relevant ISCO unit is likely within the "Health Professionals" (Major code 22). However, without more details, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact specialization. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title Analysis:** "Doctor" is a very broad term. It could refer to a general practitioner, a specialist, a surgeon, or even a veterinarian. 
2. **Website Context:**  "VisiDarbi.lv" suggests a general job board, not one specific to a medical specialty. This further supports the lack of specific information.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): **2211**
ISCO Title: **Generalist medical practitioners**
Confidence: **0.2** 
Reasoning: Given the lack of information, assuming a general medical doctor is the most likely scenario. However, confidence is very low due to the lack of information.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 2212, 2250, 2261**

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **2212 - Specialist medical practitioners:** It's possible the advertisement refers to a specialist, but without details, it's equally likely to be a general practitioner.
* **2250 - Dentists:**  "Doctor" could refer to a dentist, though less common in casual language.
* **2261 - Optometrists and ophthalmic opticians:**  Another possibility, but less likely than the above options. 

**Conclusion:**  Without a more detailed job description, it's impossible to accurately assign an ISCO code with high confidence.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title:** The title "PTO Electrical Clerk of Works" explicitly mentions "Clerk of Works" and "Electrical," suggesting a role related to overseeing electrical work.

2. **Examine ISCO 3112 (Civil engineering technicians):** This unit includes "Clerk of Works" and involves technical tasks in construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings, aligning with the job ad. The "Electrical" aspect in the title suggests a specialization within civil engineering technology.

3. **Consider ISCO 2151 (Electrical engineers):** While this unit deals with electrical systems, it focuses on design, research, and high-level engineering tasks. The job ad doesn't mention such responsibilities, making this unit less likely.

4. **Evaluate ISCO 3113 (Electrical engineering technicians):** This unit involves technical assistance in electrical engineering, design, installation, and maintenance. However, the primary focus is on assisting engineers rather than overseeing work as a Clerk of Works would.

5. **Review remaining ISCO units:** The remaining units focus on general office tasks, payroll, production, transport, personnel, electricians, and electrical mechanics. None of these align with the combined responsibilities of overseeing electrical work implied by the job title.

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3112
**ISCO Title:** Civil engineering technicians
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Reasoning:** The job title explicitly mentions "Clerk of Works," a role directly listed under ISCO 3112. The "Electrical" specification suggests a specialization within this unit, focusing on the electrical aspects of construction and maintenance. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3113, 7411, 7412.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Sales Coach," and the description emphasizes training and developing the sales team. This already points away from direct sales roles and towards training-focused positions.

2. **Examine main responsibilities and tasks:** The core tasks revolve around identifying training needs, designing and delivering training programs, preparing materials, and onboarding new salespeople. This aligns strongly with the tasks of training and staff development professionals.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:**  The ad emphasizes communication skills, motivation ability, familiarity with training methodologies (role-playing, e-learning), and problem-solving. These are all crucial for effective training and development roles.

4. **Analyze ISCO units in descending relevance:**

    * **2424 - Training and staff development professionals:** This unit perfectly encapsulates the job description. The tasks and skills align almost perfectly. 
    * **2356 - Information technology trainers:** While training is a key component, this role is not specific to IT. 
    * **2359 - Teaching professionals not elsewhere classified:** This is too broad. The focus is on sales-specific training, not general education.
    * **1221 - Sales and marketing managers:** This involves managing sales teams and activities, not primarily training them.
    * **2433 - Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT):** This is a direct sales role, not a training position.
    * **2434 - Information and communications technology (ICT) sales professionals:**  Similar to 2433, this is focused on direct sales, not training.
    * **3322 - Commercial sales representatives:** Again, this is a direct sales role, not a training position.
    * **3422 - Sports coaches, instructors and officials:** While sharing some similarities with coaching, the context and skills required are different.
    * **5223 - Shop sales assistants:** This is a retail position with no relation to training or coaching.
    * **5244 - Contact centre salespersons:**  This is a direct sales role focused on telephone and electronic communication.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2424
**ISCO Title:** Training and staff development professionals 
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job description's emphasis on training needs analysis, program design and delivery, material preparation, and onboarding aligns perfectly with the role of a training and staff development professional. The required skills further solidify this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided 2424 is a very strong match.

Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job advertisement**

The job advertisement describes a platform, 20 Cogs, that allows users to earn money online by completing various tasks such as competitions, offers, gaming, and surveys. The advertisement emphasizes the ease of use, the potential to earn extra cash, and the lack of special skills required. 

**Step 2: Compare with provided ISCO units**

Analyzing the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance:

* **3421 - Athletes and sport players:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not mention any sporting activities or competitions.
* **4212 - Bookmakers and croupiers and related gaming workers:** While the job advertisement mentions "gaming," it's unlikely to refer to the type of gambling activities this unit describes. 
* **4213 - Pawnbrokers and money-lenders:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve lending money or evaluating pledges.
* **7115 - Carpenters and joiners:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve woodworking or construction.
* **7522 - Cabinet-makers and related workers:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve woodworking or furniture making.

* **8156 - Shoemaking and related machine operators:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve operating machinery or producing footwear.
* **9510 - Street and related services workers:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve providing services on the street.
* **9622 - Odd-job persons:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve cleaning, painting, or repairing buildings.
* **9623 - Meter readers and vending-machine collectors:** This unit is not relevant. The job advertisement does not involve collecting money from machines or reading meters.

**Step 3: Rationale for no match and alternative ISCO units**

None of the provided ISCO units accurately reflect the job described in the advertisement. The job appears to fall under the category of online paid tasks or micro-tasks, which is not directly represented in the provided options.

**Alternative ISCO units:**

1. **4321 - Market research interviewers and public opinion pollers:** This unit could potentially match as it involves collecting data through surveys, which is one of the tasks mentioned in the advertisement. 
2. **3513 - Web and multimedia developers:**  Depending on the nature of the "competitions" and "gaming" offered, this unit might be relevant if those tasks involve interacting with online platforms or content creation.
3. **9614 - Other personal services workers:** This is a broad category and could potentially encompass the various online tasks described in the advertisement, as it includes "workers not elsewhere classified providing personal services directly to individuals."

## ISCO Code Analysis for "Administrative and Sales Employee" 

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided job advertisement:

**1. Job Title and Description Analysis:**

* The job title "Administrative and Sales Employee" suggests a combined role handling both administrative tasks and customer interactions related to sales. 
* This immediately makes certain ISCO units less likely, such as those focused solely on sales (e.g., ICT Sales Professionals, Commercial Sales Representatives) or those purely administrative without a customer-facing aspect.

**2. Main Responsibilities and Tasks:**

The job ad lists these key responsibilities:

* **Customer Relationship Management:** Responding to emails and phone calls, demonstrating tact and diplomacy.
* **Product Information Management:** Creating and populating product information sheets.
* **E-commerce Support:** Participating in e-commerce projects.
* **Logistical Support:** Assisting the logistics team with tasks like packaging.

**3. Required Skills and Qualifications:**

* **Excellent written and spoken French.**
* **Strong customer service skills (tact, diplomacy).**
* **Proficiency in computer skills (e-commerce platforms, ERP systems).**
* **Attention to detail, rigor, dynamism, customer-oriented mindset, good interpersonal skills.**
* **PrestaShop knowledge is a plus.**

**4. Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:**

Considering the blend of responsibilities, the ideal ISCO unit should fall under:

* **Major Group 3:** Technicians and Associate Professionals (due to the required skillset and the mix of administrative and potentially technical tasks related to e-commerce).
* **Sub-major Group 33:** Business and Administration Associate Professionals (aligning with the core administrative and sales support nature of the role).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning for Provided ISCO Units:**

* **2434 - Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Sales Professionals:**  While the job mentions e-commerce and requires computer skills, the primary focus is not on selling technical ICT products. This makes it less likely.
* **3322 - Commercial Sales Representatives:** This is closer, but the job emphasizes customer service and e-commerce support more than direct sales. The ad doesn't mention typical sales tasks like quoting prices or negotiating contracts.
* **3323 - Buyers:** This is not a match. The role doesn't involve procuring goods or negotiating contracts with suppliers.
* **3339 - Business Services Agents:** This is too broad. While the role involves customer interaction, it lacks the specific focus on services like advertising, auctions, or talent representation that defines this unit.
* **3432 - Interior Designers and Decorators:** This is completely unrelated to the job description.
* **4222 - Contact Centre Information Clerks:** This is the closest match so far. The tasks align well: providing information, responding to queries, potentially processing orders (transactions). The focus on customer service and communication is key.
* **4419 - Clerical Support Workers:** This is too general. While the role has administrative aspects, it's more specialized than a generic clerical position.
* **5223 - Shop Sales Assistants:** This doesn't fit. The role is online/e-commerce focused, not in a physical shop.
* **5244 - Contact Centre Salespersons:** This is less likely than 4222. While there's customer contact, the emphasis is on support and service rather than actively pushing sales. 

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 4222
**ISCO Title:** Contact Centre Information Clerks 
**Confidence:** 0.8 
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly emphasizes customer service, providing information, and handling inquiries via phone and email, aligning well with the core tasks of this ISCO unit. The e-commerce and administrative aspects are also consistent with supporting customers in an online environment.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 5244, 4419, 3322

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **5244 (Contact Centre Salespersons):** If the role involves more active selling and upselling within the e-commerce platform, this could be a secondary option.
* **4419 (Clerical Support Workers):**  This is a broader category that could apply if the e-commerce and customer service aspects are less specialized.
* **3322 (Commercial Sales Representatives):**  If the role evolves to include more direct sales responsibilities over time, this might become more relevant.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title emphasizes an "Unsolicited Internship" suggesting a general application rather than a specific role. The description confirms this, highlighting the opportunity to work in various departments ("Communications, Marketing and Sales, HR, IT, Finance, and many more"). This indicates the job duties are not confined to a single ISCO unit's typical tasks.

2. **Evaluate main responsibilities and tasks:** The advertisement focuses on providing "practical experience" and contributing "innovative thoughts." Specific tasks are not outlined, implying a flexible role adapting to the chosen department's needs. This lack of specific tasks makes it difficult to align with the very specific task lists of the provided ISCO units.

3. **Assess required skills and qualifications:** The ad prioritizes "ambitious students" with "curiosity" and a "willingness to learn" over specific skills. While some ISCO units value these traits, they are not the primary focus. This suggests the internship is more about general professional development than specialized technical skills.

4. **Consider major, sub-major, and minor groups:**  The broad departmental range ("Communications, Marketing and Sales, HR, IT, Finance, and many more") spans across multiple ISCO major groups. This reinforces the internship's general nature, making it difficult to pinpoint a single best-fitting group.

## Conclusion:

None of the provided ISCO units accurately represent the advertised "Unsolicited Internship." The internship's inherent flexibility and focus on general professional development, rather than specialized tasks, make it a poor fit for the specific, task-oriented nature of the provided ISCO units.

## Alternative ISCO Codes:

Based on the internship's emphasis on professional development and potential for placement in various departments, here are three alternative ISCO units that could be relevant:

1. **ISCO Code:** 3343
   **ISCO Title:** Human Resources and Training Clerks
   **Confidence:** 0.4
   **Reasoning:** This unit includes tasks related to recruitment and training, which could align with the internship's focus on providing practical experience and supporting professional development.

2. **ISCO Code:** 4110
   **ISCO Title:** Secretaries
   **Confidence:** 0.3
   **Reasoning:** Depending on the department, interns might assist with administrative tasks, communication, and organization, aligning with some responsibilities of secretaries.

3. **ISCO Code:** 2631
   **ISCO Title:** Computer Programmers
   **Confidence:** 0.2

Response:
Unfortunately, the provided job advertisement only gives the job title and mentions that it is a job offer. There is no information about the job description, responsibilities, tasks, required skills, or qualifications. 

Therefore, it is impossible to determine the appropriate ISCO unit based on the given information. 

To make an accurate ISCO unit prediction, a detailed job description is needed. 

However, based on the limited information available, we can make some assumptions and suggest potential ISCO units that *could* be relevant. 

**Potential ISCO units based on the job title alone:**

* **ISCO Code:** 1212 
    * **ISCO Title:** Human resource managers
    * **Confidence:** 0.2
    * **Reasoning:** The title "IM Business Partner for Finance & Commercial" suggests a role related to business partnership and potentially involves managing human resources within the finance and commercial departments. 
* **ISCO Code:** 1211
    * **ISCO Title:** Finance managers
    * **Confidence:** 0.15
    * **Reasoning:** The title mentions "Finance & Commercial," indicating a possible connection to financial management. 
* **ISCO Code:** 1219
    * **ISCO Title:** Business services and administration managers not elsewhere classified
    * **Confidence:** 0.1
    * **Reasoning:**  This is a broader category that could potentially encompass the role if it involves managing business services related to finance and commercial operations.

**Alternative ISCO Codes:** 2412, 2423, 3322

**It is crucial to emphasize that these are just speculative suggestions based on the extremely limited information.**  A thorough analysis and accurate ISCO code prediction require a detailed job description.

## ISCO Unit Analysis for "OIO OM NTM Administrator"

**1. Analyzing the provided ISCO units:**

* **2149: Engineering Professionals not elsewhere classified:** This unit is the most relevant based on the limited information and the emphasis on "nuclear experience." The job title includes "Administrator," which doesn't perfectly align with the engineering focus of this ISCO unit. However, the requirement for nuclear experience and the job's likely context within a nuclear project suggest this unit as a strong possibility. 
* **3131: Power Production Plant Operators:**  While the job might be related to nuclear power, the title "Administrator" doesn't align with the operational nature of this ISCO unit. 
* **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining ISCO units focus on health, management, policy, IT, or water treatment, none of which directly relate to the provided job advertisement.

**2. Reasoning:**

The job advertisement is extremely vague.  We can infer the following:

* **Industry:** Nuclear 
* **Seniority:**  The title "Administrator" suggests a role with managerial or oversight responsibilities.
* **Technical Expertise:** "Nuclear experience is mandatory" implies a need for specialized knowledge in nuclear operations or engineering.

**3. Challenges:**

* **Lack of Clarity:** The abbreviations "OIO" and "OM/NTM" are not standard and make it difficult to pinpoint the job's exact nature. 
* **Limited Information:** The advertisement doesn't describe responsibilities, required qualifications, or the level of autonomy.

**4.  Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2149
* **ISCO Title:** Engineering Professionals not elsewhere classified
* **Confidence:** 0.6 
* **Reasoning:**  Given the limited information, the focus on "nuclear experience" leads to classifying this role within engineering professions. However, the "Administrator" title introduces uncertainty.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1112, 2421, 2422

**5. Rationale for Alternatives and Explanation:**

* **1112: Senior Government Officials:**  If "OIO" refers to a governmental organization or regulatory body within the nuclear sector, this ISCO unit might be a fit. The "Administrator" title could align with overseeing regulatory compliance or policy implementation.
* **2421: Management and Organization Analysts:** This option is less likely but possible if the role focuses on analyzing and improving organizational processes within the nuclear project.
* **2422: Policy Administration Professionals:** If the "OIO" is a policy-focused organization within the nuclear field, this unit could be relevant. The administrator might be involved in developing or analyzing policies related to nuclear energy.

Response:
The job advertisement provides insufficient information to determine an appropriate ISCO unit. The advertisement only contains the word "INTEGRATE," offering no insight into the job's responsibilities, required skills, or industry. 

Therefore, it is impossible to confidently assign an ISCO code based on the provided information. 

**Reasoning:**

The lack of information in the job advertisement makes it impossible to compare the role with the provided ISCO unit descriptions. To make an accurate prediction, we need more context about the job.

**Alternative ISCO Codes:**

It is not possible to suggest alternative ISCO codes without more information about the job.  The word "integrate" could apply to numerous fields and roles. 

**To provide a more accurate ISCO code and increase confidence, please provide a more detailed job advertisement including:**

* **Full job title:**  (e.g., "Systems Integration Engineer," "Data Integration Specialist," "Marketing Integration Manager")
* **Job description:** Outlining the job's responsibilities, duties, and required skills.
* **Company industry:** Knowing the company's field (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance) will help narrow down potential ISCO codes.

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction: 

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2519 
**ISCO Title:** Software and applications developers and analysts n.e.c.
**Confidence:** 0.7 
**Reasoning:**  The job advertisement focuses on "Automated Security Testing Development Support".  While not explicitly stating "Software Tester", the combination of "Automated", "Security Testing", and "Development Support" strongly suggests a role heavily involved in software testing within a security context. This aligns well with the description of ISCO 2519, which includes professionals specializing in quality assurance and software testing. The student likely will help develop and implement testing procedures for security software.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2512, 3512, 3119

## Reasoning Process:

1. **Analyze the Job Title and Description:** The title emphasizes "Automated Security Testing" and "Development Support." This suggests a role related to software development but with a clear focus on the testing phase, particularly automated security testing.

2. **Consider Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2512 (Software Developers):** While software development is involved, the emphasis on "Automated Security Testing" points towards a more specialized testing role rather than general software development.
    * **2513 (Web and Multimedia Developers):** This unit is less relevant as the job ad doesn't mention web or multimedia development. 
    * **2519 (Software and Applications Developers and Analysts n.e.c.):** This unit explicitly includes software testing and quality assurance, aligning strongly with the job description.
    * **2529 (Database and Network Professionals n.e.c.):** While security is a factor, the ad focuses on testing *during* development, not solely on implementing security measures.
    * **Remaining ISCO Units:** The remaining units focus on different areas like physical sciences, engineering, or general IT support, making them less relevant.

3. **Evaluate Relevance:** ISCO 2519 emerges as the most relevant due to its direct inclusion of software testing and quality assurance specialists. The job ad's language strongly suggests a role within this domain.

4. **Alternative Options:**
    * **2512 (Software Developers):**  If the student's role involves significant coding and development of the testing frameworks themselves, 2512 could be a secondary option.
    * **3512 (Information and communications technology user support technicians):** If the role involves setting up testing environments and providing technical assistance during testing, 3512 might be a distant alternative.
    * **3119 (Physical and engineering science technicians n.e.c.):** This is less likely unless the security testing involves specific hardware or physical systems. 

5. **Final Prediction:** Based on the analysis, ISCO 2519 (Software and applications developers and analysts n.e.c.) is the most appropriate ISCO unit, with a confidence level of 0.7. While the job title doesn't explicitly state "Software Tester," the description strongly implies a role heavily involved in software testing, particularly within a security context.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Translation & Interpretation:** The job title "Alternance - assistant chef de projet moa marketing" translates to "Internship - Assistant MOA Marketing Project Manager".  This indicates a junior role assisting with marketing project management, likely with a focus on the client side (MOA - Maîtrise d'Ouvrage).

2. **Eliminating Irrelevant ISCO Units:** Based on the translated title and the provided descriptions, we can eliminate the following ISCO units as they don't align with the job ad:
    * **1221 - Sales and marketing managers:** This is a senior management role with broader responsibilities than an assistant project manager.
    * **1222 - Advertising and public relations managers:**  This role focuses on advertising and PR campaigns, not the broader scope of marketing project management.
    * **1223 - Research and development managers:** This is unrelated to marketing and project management.
    * **1312 - Aquaculture and fisheries production managers:**  This is entirely unrelated to the job ad.
    * **1323 - Construction managers:** This is unrelated to marketing and project management.
    * **1412 - Restaurant managers:** This is unrelated to marketing and project management.
    * **3251 - Dental assistants and therapists:** This is unrelated to marketing and project management.
    * **3256 - Medical assistants:** This is unrelated to marketing and project management.
    * **3434 - Chefs:** This is unrelated to marketing and project management.

3. **Analyzing the Most Relevant ISCO Unit:**

    * **2431 - Advertising and marketing professionals:** While this unit includes "Marketing specialist" as a similar job title, the description emphasizes developing advertising strategies and market research. The job ad focuses on project management within marketing, which isn't fully reflected in this unit.

4. **Alternative ISCO Units:**  Since none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match the job ad, here are three alternative options:

    * **1330 - Project and Programme Management Professionals:** This unit aligns well with the "Assistant Project Manager" aspect of the job title and likely encompasses marketing-related projects.
    * **3343 - Administrative Secretaries and Clerks:**  Depending on the internship's structure, there might be significant administrative and support tasks involved, making this a potential secondary match.
    * **2133 - Information and Communications Technology Professionals (ICT):** If the MOA Marketing Project Manager role involves digital marketing projects and requires technical understanding, this unit could be relevant.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1330
**ISCO Title:** Project and Programme Management Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.7 
**Reasoning:** The job title emphasizes "Assistant Project Manager" within a marketing context. While none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match, 1330 - Project and Programme Management Professionals aligns best with the core responsibilities implied.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3343, 2133

Response:
The provided job advertisement is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit. The description appears to be an error message related to website traffic. 

**Reasoning:**

The advertisement only provides a job title, "Business Assistant," and an error message instead of a job description. Without information on responsibilities, tasks, required skills, and qualifications, it is impossible to accurately assign an ISCO code. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes:**

Based on the job title "Business Assistant," here are three potentially relevant ISCO units:

1. **ISCO Code:** 3343
   **ISCO Title:** Administrative and Executive Secretaries
   **Reasoning:** Business assistants often provide administrative and organizational support to managers or teams, aligning with the tasks of this ISCO unit.

2. **ISCO Code:** 4120
   **ISCO Title:** Secretaries (general)
   **Reasoning:** Depending on the specific duties, a business assistant might perform tasks similar to a general secretary, such as handling correspondence, scheduling, and administrative duties.

3. **ISCO Code:** 3313
   **ISCO Title:** Accounting Associate Professionals
   **Reasoning:**  In some cases, a business assistant might have responsibilities related to financial record-keeping, bookkeeping, or assisting with accounting tasks.

**Final Prediction:**

Cannot provide a final prediction due to insufficient information in the job advertisement.

## ISCO Code Analysis for "TRAINEE" Job Advertisement:

**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**

The job title "TRAINEE" is very generic and doesn't provide specific information about the industry or skillset. The description is also very brief, mentioning only integration into a department, contribution to tasks, and supervision.

**Step 2: Compare with related job titles in potential ISCO units.**

None of the provided ISCO units have "Trainee" or similar variations listed as examples or similar job titles. This suggests the job ad might be too broad for a direct match.

**Step 3: Consider the lack of information on responsibilities, skills, and qualifications.**

The job ad doesn't mention specific responsibilities, required skills, or qualifications. This makes it difficult to align with the detailed task descriptions provided for each ISCO unit.

**Step 4: Analyze the relevance of major, sub-major, and minor groups.**

Without knowing the industry or specific tasks, it's impossible to determine the relevant major, sub-major, or minor groups for this job ad.

**Conclusion:**

The provided job advertisement is too vague to confidently assign an ISCO code.  The lack of information about the specific industry, tasks, skills, and qualifications makes it impossible to find a suitable match within the provided options.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (with rationale and descending relevance):**

It's impossible to suggest alternative ISCO codes without further information about the trainee position.  To provide a more accurate prediction, we need details about:

1. **Industry:**  What industry or sector does the department belong to (e.g., technology, finance, healthcare)?
2. **Department:** What are the primary functions of the department the trainee will be joining?
3. **Tasks:** What specific tasks and responsibilities will the trainee be assigned?
4. **Skills:** What skills or qualifications are desired for this trainee position?

Once we have this information, we can more accurately identify potential ISCO codes. 

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):**  N/A
**ISCO Title:** N/A
**Confidence:** 0 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement is too vague to confidently assign an ISCO code. More information is needed about the trainee position. 
**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  Cannot be determined without further information.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Autonomy Teamsite Tech Lead". This suggests a technical leadership role focused on HP Autonomy Teamsite, a web content management system. This aligns more with software development and systems administration than other provided ISCO unit descriptions.

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:**  While the advertisement doesn't explicitly list responsibilities, the required skills (HP Autonomy, TeamSite, Workflow Modeler, OpenDeploy, IDOL, Perl, XSLT, JAVA, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL) point towards tasks like:
    * **Developing and maintaining web applications** using HP TeamSite.
    * **Integrating different systems** using tools like HP Workflow Modeler and OpenDeploy.
    * **Potentially managing and troubleshooting** the Teamsite environment.
    * **Coding and scripting** to customize and extend the platform's functionality.

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** The required skills heavily emphasize web development technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript), programming languages (Perl, Java), and scripting (XSLT).  The inclusion of SQL suggests interaction with databases.  This skillset aligns strongly with **Web and multimedia development professionals (ISCO 2513)** and has some overlap with **Systems administrators (ISCO 2522)**.

4. **Evaluate the ISCO units:**
    * **ISCO 2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals):** This unit best matches the required skills and implied tasks. The focus on web technologies, programming, and potential for application development aligns strongly. 
    * **ISCO 2522 (Systems administrators):** While some tasks might overlap (e.g., troubleshooting), this unit's primary focus is on maintaining infrastructure rather than developing applications. The job ad's emphasis on development skills makes this a less perfect fit.
    * **The remaining ISCO units are not relevant:** They focus on life sciences, forestry, medical technicians, and pre-press work, which are entirely unrelated to the advertised position.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2513
**ISCO Title:** Web and multimedia development professionals
**Confidence:** 0.85
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement heavily emphasizes web development skills and technologies associated with HP Autonomy Teamsite, suggesting a role focused on building and maintaining web applications. This aligns strongly with the tasks and skills outlined for ISCO 2513.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2522, 2512, 3512 
    * **2512 (Software Developers)** could be a potential alternative if the role involves more custom software development within the Teamsite environment.
    * **3512 (Web Technicians)** might be relevant if the role involves more website maintenance and less active development.

## ISCO Code Analysis: Operátor/ka v Zlatých Moravciach s dopravou od Levíc

**1. Translation & Initial Observations:**

* The job title "Operátor/ka v Zlatých Moravciach s dopravou od Levíc" translates to "Operator in Zlaté Moravce with transport from Levice". 
* This suggests a job involving operation of some machinery or system, potentially in a factory or production setting, with provided transportation from Levice.

**2. Analyzing Provided ISCO Units:**

We will analyze the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance to identify the best fit:

* **5112 - Transport Conductors:** This option is highly unlikely. The job ad mentions "operator" and "transport," but it's unlikely to refer to a ticket conductor role. The ad lacks any mention of passengers, tickets, or safety duties typical for this ISCO unit.

* **8321 - Motorcycle Drivers:**  This is also unlikely. While "transport" could imply driving, the job title "Operator" doesn't align with typical motorcycle driver roles. There's no mention of deliveries or tasks specific to motorcycle drivers.

* **8331 - Bus and Tram Drivers:**  This is not a match. The job ad doesn't mention driving buses or trams. The title "Operator" is too general, and there's no reference to passenger transport, routes, or fares.

* **8332 - Heavy Truck and Lorry Drivers:**  This is also unlikely. The job ad doesn't mention driving heavy vehicles or transporting goods. The focus on "operator" and the lack of details about truck driving make this a poor fit.

* **8341 - Mobile Farm and Forestry Plant Operators:**  This is not a match. The job ad provides no indication of agricultural or forestry work.  The required skills and tasks for this ISCO unit are not reflected in the advertisement.

* **8342 - Earthmoving and Related Plant Operators:** This is also unlikely. The job ad doesn't mention operating earthmoving machinery. The tasks and skills associated with this ISCO unit are not reflected in the advertisement.

* **8343 - Crane, Hoist and Related Plant Operators:** This is a possible match. The term "Operator" could align with operating cranes or hoists. However, the ad lacks specifics about construction, lifting equipment, or related tasks. 

* **8344 - Lifting Truck Operators:** This is another possible match. "Operator" could refer to operating a forklift or similar lifting truck within a factory or warehouse setting. This aligns with the potential for a production environment implied by the job title.

* **9331 - Hand and Pedal Vehicle Drivers:** This is not a match. The job ad doesn't suggest manual labor or transportation using non-motorized vehicles.

* **9332 - Drivers of Animal-Drawn Vehicles and Machinery:** This is not a match. The job ad doesn't suggest working with animals or using animal-drawn vehicles.

**3. Conclusion and Alternative Predictions:**

Based on the limited information, none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match the job advertisement. The vague description makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact role. 

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
* **ISCO Title:** Lifting-truck operators
* **Confidence:** 0.4 
* **Reasoning:**  "Operator" in a potentially production-related environment ("Zlaté Moravce" is a city known for industry) hints at a role involving machinery operation. Lifting truck operation is a plausible assumption given the limited information.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 8343, 7122, 9333

* **8343 - Crane, Hoist and Related Plant Operators:**  A secondary possibility if the "operator" role involves construction or heavy machinery.
* **7122 - Metalworkers and Related Trades Workers:** A broader category that could be relevant if the job involves metal processing or manufacturing.
* **9333 -  Freight Handlers:** A possibility if the role involves manual handling of goods within a warehouse or factory setting.

## ISCO Unit Analysis for "Operations Support Team Member"

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement against the provided ISCO units:

**1. ISCO 3131: Power production plant operators**

* **Match:** The job is located at a "Nuclear site" and mentions "POCO" (Preservation of Configuration Control) which is a term often used in nuclear power plants. This suggests the role could involve power plant operations.
* **Mismatch:** The job description focuses heavily on planning, documentation, audits, and liaising with SMEs. It lacks specific tasks related to operating, monitoring, or maintaining power plant equipment as described in ISCO 3131. 
* **Conclusion:** While the job's location and terminology hint at a power plant setting, the core responsibilities don't align with the hands-on operational tasks of ISCO 3131.

**2. ISCO 3132: Incinerator and water treatment plant operators**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on waste and water treatment processes, which are not mentioned in the job advertisement. 
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**3. ISCO 3133: Chemical processing plant controllers**

* **Mismatch:** Similar to the previous unit, this ISCO deals with chemical processing, a field not reflected in the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on metal processing and production, which is not relevant to the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**5. ISCO 3511: Information and communications technology operations technicians**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on IT systems and equipment operation, which is not the focus of the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**6. ISCO 8111: Miners and quarriers**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit is clearly not a match as it involves physical extraction of resources, entirely unrelated to the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**7. ISCO 8112: Mineral and stone processing plant operators**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on processing raw materials, which is not relevant to the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**8. ISCO 8121: Metal processing plant operators**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on operating machinery for metal processing, which is not relevant to the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**9. ISCO 8131: Chemical products plant and machine operators**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on operating machinery for chemical product manufacturing, which is not relevant to the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**10. ISCO 8182: Steam engine and boiler operators**

* **Mismatch:** This ISCO unit focuses on operating and maintaining steam-powered systems, which is not relevant to the job description.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement.

**Rationale for No Exact Match:**

None of the provided ISCO units accurately reflect the job advertisement's focus on POCO planning, documentation, audits, and stakeholder liaison within a nuclear facility. The role seems to lean towards project management or coordination within a specific technical environment.

**Alternative ISCO Codes:**

Based on the job description, here are three potentially relevant ISCO codes:

1. **ISCO 3116: Industrial engineers:** This unit encompasses planning, organizing, and controlling production processes, including aspects like safety and efficiency, which align with the job's responsibilities.
2. **ISCO 3122: Chemical engineers:** Given the nuclear setting, a chemical engineering background could be relevant for understanding and managing POCO processes related to chemical handling and waste.
3. **ISCO 1331: Manufacturing Supervisors:** This unit involves coordinating and supervising production and operations, which aligns with the job's emphasis on planning and overseeing POCO activities.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** None of the provided ISCO units match.
**ISCO Title:** N/A
**Confidence:** 0
**Reasoning:** The job description primarily focuses on planning, documentation, and coordination related to POCO within a nuclear facility, which doesn't align with the operational focus of the provided ISCO units.
**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3116, 3122, 1331

Response:
The provided job advertisement contains no information about the advertised position. It only shows information about LinkedIn itself and encourages users to upgrade their browsers. Therefore, it is impossible to determine an appropriate ISCO code based on this advertisement. 

Here are three potentially relevant ISCO codes, assuming the advertisement is for a position at LinkedIn:

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2529, 2423, 3512

**Reasoning:**

* **2529 (Database and network professionals not elsewhere classified):**  LinkedIn is a platform heavily reliant on databases and networks. This category includes roles like data miners and security specialists, which could be relevant to LinkedIn's operations.
* **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):** As a large company, LinkedIn likely has a substantial HR department. This code covers roles related to recruitment, training, and other personnel functions.
* **3512 (Information and communications technology user support technicians):**  Being an online platform, LinkedIn requires a strong IT support team to assist users and maintain the platform's functionality.

Response:
I cannot fulfill this request. The provided job advertisement lacks specific responsibilities, tasks, and required skills and qualifications needed to determine the appropriate ISCO unit. The advertisement focuses on the company's mission and values rather than the specific job requirements. 

To provide an accurate ISCO unit prediction, I need a job advertisement that outlines:

* **Specific responsibilities and tasks:** What will the employee do on a day-to-day basis?
* **Required skills and qualifications:** What education, experience, and skills are necessary for the role?
* **Level of expertise and autonomy:** Is this an entry-level or senior position? How much supervision will the employee receive?

## ISCO Unit Analysis for Gorillas Internship (MBA)

**1. Analyzing the provided ISCO units:**

* **1219 - Business Services and Administration Managers:** While the internship mentions administrative duties, it emphasizes learning and development within specific departments (Operations, Commercial, Supply Chain, etc.) rather than managing administrative services. This unit focuses on established managerial roles, not internships.
* **1221 - Sales and Marketing Managers:**  The internship mentions "Commercial" as a potential team, suggesting a connection to sales and marketing. However, the focus is on general business development within a fast-growing startup, not solely on sales and marketing management. 
* **1324 - Supply, Distribution and Related Managers:** The "Supply Chain" team aligns with this unit. However, the internship's broad scope and emphasis on learning across departments suggest a broader business focus than just supply chain management.
* **1412 - Restaurant Managers:** This unit is irrelevant to Gorillas' business model (grocery delivery) and the internship description.
* **1420 - Retail and Wholesale Trade Managers:**  While Gorillas operates in retail, the internship emphasizes a broader business development experience rather than managing a retail store. The required skills like SQL and project management point towards a more analytical and strategic role.
* **3323 - Buyers:**  The internship doesn't focus on procurement or purchasing tasks. 
* **5221 - Shopkeepers:** This unit is irrelevant as the internship is within a corporate environment, not a small shop.
* **5222 - Shop Supervisors:** Similar to 5221, this unit doesn't align with the internship's corporate setting and responsibilities.
* **6113 - Gardeners, Horticultural and Nursery Growers:**  Completely irrelevant to the job advertisement.
* **6129 - Other Market-Oriented Animal Producers:**  Completely irrelevant to the job advertisement.

**2. Rationale for No Perfect Match:**

None of the provided ISCO units perfectly capture the internship's nature. The internship emphasizes a broad, hands-on learning experience within a specific department of a fast-growing startup, focusing on developing skills applicable across various business functions.

**3. Alternative ISCO Units:**

Based on the job description, here are three potentially relevant ISCO units:

* **3340 - Business and Administration Professionals not elsewhere classified:** This unit encompasses roles involving analysis, reporting, and supporting business operations, aligning with the internship's description of administrative duties, data analysis (SQL), and project management.
* **2421 - Business Professionals:** This unit includes roles requiring business acumen and knowledge across different departments, reflecting the internship's focus on developing a holistic understanding of Gorillas' operations.
* **3512 - Information and Communications Technology Operations Technicians:** While broader than the internship's scope, this unit could be relevant if the internship involves working with technology and data analysis within the chosen department.

**4. Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3340
**ISCO Title:** Business and Administration Professionals not elsewhere classified
**Confidence:** 0.7 
**Reasoning:** This unit best reflects the internship's emphasis on administrative tasks, data analysis, and project management within a business setting. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2421, 3512

Response:
## ISCO Code Analysis: 

**1. Translation and Initial Observation:**

* The job title "PAGALBINIS DARBUOTOJAS(-Ė) KĖDAINIUOSE!" translates to "ASSISTANT WORKER in Kėdainiai!". 
* This title is very general and doesn't give us much information about the specific industry or tasks involved.

**2. Analyzing Provided ISCO Units:**

* **7314 (Potters and related workers):**  This is immediately irrelevant. The ad doesn't mention pottery, ceramics, or any related materials.
* **7318 (Handicraft workers in textile...):**  Also irrelevant. No mention of textiles, leather, or traditional crafts.
* **7323 (Print finishing and binding workers):**  Irrelevant. The ad doesn't suggest work in printing or bookbinding.
* **7521 (Wood treaters):**  Irrelevant. No indication of woodworking or wood treatment.
* **8142 (Plastic products machine operators):**  Irrelevant.  No mention of plastics manufacturing.
* **8151 (Fibre preparing, spinning... operators):** Irrelevant.  The ad doesn't suggest textile manufacturing.
* **8154 (Bleaching, dyeing... machine operators):** Irrelevant. No connection to textile treatment processes.
* **8181 (Glass and ceramics plant operators):** Irrelevant. No mention of glass or ceramics production.
* **9215 (Forestry labourers):**  Unlikely. While "assistant worker" could be very broad, forestry is specific. 
* **9329 (Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified):**  **Most likely.** This is a very general category for laborers assisting in manufacturing. Given the lack of information in the ad, this is the most plausible fit.

**3. Rationale for No Perfect Match:**

The job advertisement is extremely vague. It provides no details about the industry, tasks, skills, or qualifications. 

**4. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 9329
* **ISCO Title:** Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified
* **Confidence:** 0.3 
* **Reasoning:** Due to the extreme vagueness, this is the broadest category that fits an "assistant worker" role.  However, it's a low-confidence prediction.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 
* **9111 (Cleaners and Helpers):**  This is possible if the assistant role involves basic cleaning tasks in any industry.
* **9622 (Freight handlers):**  If the job involves manual handling of goods, this could be a fit.
* **5132 (Sales and Service Clerks):**  A stretch, but if the location is retail-oriented, it's remotely possible.

## ISCO Unit Analysis: Carpenter Job Advertisement

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit code:

**1. Job Title and Description Analysis:**

* **Job Title:** "Carpenter" 
* **Description:** The advertisement explicitly mentions "Carpenter" multiple times and lists carpentry-related skills (roofing, 2nd fix carpentry). 
* **Related Job Titles (ISCO units):**  The ISCO unit **7115: Carpenters and Joiners** has a direct match with the job title and aligns with the description's emphasis on carpentry skills.

**2. Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* The advertisement focuses on skills and experience rather than listing specific tasks. However, the required skills (roofing, 2nd fix carpentry) imply tasks like:
    * Constructing and repairing roof structures.
    * Installing fixtures and fittings (2nd fix carpentry).
    * Potentially working with wood and other materials on a construction site.

**3. Skills and Qualifications:**

* **Blue CSCS card:**  Indicates basic health and safety training required for UK construction sites.
* **3 years experience:**  Suggests a skilled worker rather than an entry-level position.
* **Roofing experience:**  A specific carpentry skill set.
* **2nd fix carpentry experience:** Another specific carpentry skill set.

**4. Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:**

* **ISCO 7115 (Carpenters and Joiners):**
    * **Major Group 7:** Craft and Related Trades Workers - Aligns with the hands-on, skilled nature of the job.
    * **Sub-major Group 71:** Building and Related Trades Workers - Matches the construction industry context.
    * **Minor Group 711:** Building Frame and Related Trades Workers -  Fits with the core carpentry tasks implied.

**Reasoning:**

The job advertisement strongly indicates a skilled carpentry role within the construction industry. The job title, required skills, and experience level all point towards ISCO unit **7115: Carpenters and Joiners** as the most accurate classification.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 7115
* **ISCO Title:** Carpenters and Joiners
* **Confidence:** 1.0 
* **Reasoning:** The job title, required skills (roofing, 2nd fix carpentry), and experience requirement directly match the definition and tasks associated with ISCO 7115. 
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO unit is a perfect match, so alternatives are not required.

Job Ad ID: 857529910, Row: 25663, Pred: 3258, 2240, 2211, 2212, 3256, 5411, 2142, 2230, 1342, 3344
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "CESR Fellow/Registrar in Emergency Medicine" clearly points to a medical professional specializing in emergency medicine. This is further confirmed by the description, which emphasizes responsibilities like assessing and treating patients in the Emergency Department, acting as a resuscitation team leader, and supervising junior doctors.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO unit descriptions:**
    * **2212 - Specialist medical practitioners:** This unit's description and listed examples (especially "Emergency medicine specialist") strongly align with the job advertisement. The tasks described, such as diagnosing, treating, and performing surgery, match the responsibilities outlined in the ad.
    * **Other ISCO units:** The remaining units focus on management (1342), general medical practice (2211), alternative medicine (2230), paramedical work (2240), medical assistance (3256), ambulance services (3258), and medical secretarial tasks (3344). None of these align with the specialized medical role described in the advertisement.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** While the ad doesn't explicitly list qualifications, it implies a high level of medical expertise due to the responsibilities and the mention of progressing to a registrar roster. This further supports the suitability of ISCO unit 2212.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO unit 2212 falls under Major group 2 (Professionals), Sub-major group 22 (Health Professionals). This categorization accurately reflects the professional and specialized nature of the advertised role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2212
**ISCO Title:** Specialist medical practitioners
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and responsibilities strongly indicate a specialist medical practitioner role focusing on emergency medicine, aligning perfectly with ISCO unit 2212.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as 2212 is a perfect match.

## Job Advertisement Analysis:

**English Translation:**

**Title:** Production Worker with Forklift License - Night Shift

**Description:** A company in the chemical sector dedicated to the manufacturing of inks and varnishes needs a production worker for their facilities in Badalona.

**Tasks:** Production and movement of loads.

**Schedule:** Initially from 9:30 PM to 6:00 AM (night shift), although there are possibilities of changing to daytime hours.

**Salary:** 10.62€ gross per hour (night bonus of 2.40€) paid through a temporary employment agency.

**Contract:** Initial 2-month contract that will be extended.

## ISCO Unit Analysis:

1. **3133 - Chemical processing plant controllers:** While the company operates in the chemical sector, the job ad focuses on "production and movement of loads" and explicitly mentions a forklift license. This suggests a more hands-on role rather than controlling and monitoring chemical processes. Therefore, this ISCO unit is not a good fit.

2. **7521 - Wood treaters:** This ISCO unit is entirely unrelated to the job advertisement, focusing on wood treatment processes. Therefore, it is not a suitable match.

3. **8131 - Chemical products plant and machine operators:** This unit is closer to the job description as it involves operating machinery in a chemical production environment. However, the emphasis on "movement of loads" and the forklift requirement points towards a more logistics-focused role within the factory, not directly operating production machinery. 

4. **8132 - Photographic products machine operators:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement as it focuses on photographic film and paper production.

5. **8160 - Food and related products machine operators:** This unit is not a match as it deals with food and beverage processing, not ink and varnish manufacturing.

6. **8171 - Pulp and papermaking plant operators:** This ISCO unit is not relevant to the job advertisement as it focuses on pulp and paper production.

7. **8183 - Packing, bottling and labelling machine operators:** This unit involves operating packaging machinery, which could be part of the job. However, the primary focus on "production and movement of loads" and the forklift requirement suggests a broader role than just operating packaging machines.

8. **8344 - Lifting truck operators:** This ISCO unit aligns perfectly with the job advertisement. The job explicitly requires a forklift license and focuses on the "movement of loads," which are the primary tasks of a lifting truck operator. 

9. **9329 - Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified:** While this unit covers general manufacturing labor, the specific requirement of a forklift license and the emphasis on "movement of loads" makes the more specialized ISCO unit 8344 a better fit.

10. **9333 - Freight handlers:** This ISCO unit is too broad. While it includes handling goods, the job advertisement specifically mentions factory work and forklift operation, making ISCO unit 8344 more appropriate.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8344

**ISCO Title:** Lifting truck operators

**Confidence:** 0.95

**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly requires a forklift license and emphasizes "production and movement of loads" within a factory setting. These responsibilities align perfectly with the tasks and skills associated with Lifting truck operators (ISCO 8344).

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 8131, 8183, 9329

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Office Cleaner". This title is a strong match for ISCO unit **9112: Cleaners and helpers in offices, hotels and other establishments**, which lists "Office cleaner" as an example occupation.

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The job description emphasizes general office cleaning tasks such as:
    - Vacuuming, sweeping, mopping floors.
    - Cleaning desks and surfaces.
    - Cleaning welfare areas (toilets, basins).
    - Cleaning shared spaces (kitchen).
    - Loading/unloading dishwasher, washing mugs, emptying bins.

    These tasks align perfectly with the description of ISCO unit **9112**, which includes cleaning floors, furniture, kitchens, bathrooms, and removing garbage.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The job ad requires:
    - Good eye for detail.
    - Sense of satisfaction from a job well done.
    - Cleaning experience (ideal).
    - Understanding of health, safety, and welfare.

    These requirements match the **Skill level 1 (low)** associated with ISCO unit **9112**.  While experience is preferred, the ad doesn't list specific certifications or extensive training, suggesting an entry-level position.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO unit **9112** falls under:
    - Major group **9: Elementary Occupations**.
    - Sub-major group **91: Cleaners and Helpers**.

    This classification accurately reflects the nature of the advertised position, which involves routine cleaning tasks without complex decision-making or specialized skills.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 9112
**ISCO Title:** Cleaners and helpers in offices, hotels and other establishments
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and overall job complexity strongly align with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 9112.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO unit is a perfect match, so no alternatives are needed.

## ISCO Unit Analysis for "Begeleider MBO niveau 3" 

**Job Advertisement Translation:**

**Title:** Educational Counselor MBO Level 3 
**Description:** Are you looking for flexible work as an Educational Counselor (employed or freelance) in Amsterdam and surroundings and do you have an affinity with Welfare and psychiatric clients? Then quickly view this vacancy and register safely online at Zorgwerk within 8 minutes. 

**(The rest of the advertisement describes the company, benefits, and application process. The key responsibilities and requirements are outlined in the "Job Description" and "Requirements" sections).**

**Job Description:** You will work flexibly for Zorgwerk's clients as an after-school care/daycare Educational Counselor in Amsterdam and the Amstelland region. You can work for our clients in the field of Welfare and Psychiatric clients. As an educational counselor in childcare, you guide groups of children in a daycare center, after-school care (BSO), after-school care (NSO) or preschool. You, as an educational counselor, ensure a homely atmosphere in which children feel safe. You keep a close eye on the development of the children and the group, so it is important to be attentive and alert. If there are any problems, you will discuss this with your colleagues, the parents or an expert. Parents can also contact you if they have any questions. You organize activities in the field of sports and exercise, art and creativity. These activities contribute to the upbringing of the children and are appropriate for their age. In this way you guide and stimulate children in their social, emotional and cognitive development. You are also responsible for the inventory of common and group rooms, whereby you perform light household tasks. 

**Requirements:**
* You have a diploma that qualifies you for the position of pedagogical employee for daycare or BSO/NSO according to the Childcare Collective Labor Agreement, such as SPW 3/4 (MBO), HBO Pedagogy or PABO.
* You have experience in daycare or after-school care.
* You have good communication skills and can function both independently and in a team.
* You are registered in the Personal Registration Childcare or you are prepared to register. For this you need to apply for a Certificate of Good Conduct (VOG) (we will reimburse the VOG after your first worked shift).
* VVE certificate and language test qualification 3F for preschool education is an advantage.
* You are enthusiastic about working through Zorgwerk.
* You have a strong sense of responsibility.
* Very reliable, the client can count on you.
* You represent childcare in a representative manner, in terms of clothing choice and behavior.
* You have an affinity with Welfare and psychiatric clients.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **ISCO Code: 1341, Child care services managers:** While the title includes "Begeleider" (Counselor), the description focuses on direct care and education of children, not management tasks like budgeting, staffing, or program development. This code is a less likely match.

2. **ISCO Code: 2342, Early childhood educators:** This code aligns strongly with the job description. The tasks described (organizing activities, promoting development, observing behavior, communicating with parents) are central to early childhood education. The required qualifications (relevant diploma, experience) also match. This is a highly likely match.

3. **ISCO Code: 2352, Special needs teachers:** While the job mentions "affinity with Welfare and psychiatric clients," it doesn't explicitly state working with children with disabilities is the primary focus.  This code is less likely than 2342 unless the client population is specifically special needs.

4. **ISCO Code: 2359, Other teaching professionals:** This is a broader category and could be a fallback option if no other teaching code fits perfectly. However, 2342 (Early childhood educators) is a more specific and accurate match based on the description.

5. **ISCO Code: 2423, Personnel and careers professionals:** This code is entirely unrelated to the job advertisement, focusing on HR and recruitment, not childcare.

6. **ISCO Code: 3333, Employment agents and contractors:** This code is also irrelevant, dealing with connecting job seekers with employers, not providing childcare services.

7. **ISCO Code: 3412, Social work associate professionals:** While the job mentions "affinity with Welfare and psychiatric clients," the core duties are childcare-focused. This code might be relevant if the role involved significant case management or social work alongside education, but that's not clear from the advertisement.

8. **ISCO Code: 5164, Pet groomers and animal care workers:** This code is completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

9. **ISCO Code: 5311, Child care workers:** This code is a possible match, as it encompasses providing care and supervision to children. However, the required qualifications (specific diplomas) and the emphasis on educational activities suggest a higher skill level than a typical child care worker. 

10. **ISCO Code: 5322, Home-based personal care workers:** This code is not a match, as the job is located in a childcare setting, not a private home.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2342
**ISCO Title:** Early childhood educators
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and qualifications of an early childhood educator, focusing on the social, emotional, and cognitive development of children in a daycare or after-school care setting.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "7.5 Tonne Driver" clearly indicates the operation of a heavy goods vehicle for transportation purposes. This immediately points towards ISCO units related to truck drivers.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job description emphasizes:
    * Planning delivery routes.
    * Carrying out vehicle safety checks.
    * Collecting and delivering parcels to various locations.
    * Lifting and carrying parcels up to 30kg.

    These tasks align strongly with the description of **Heavy truck and lorry drivers (ISCO 8332)**, who transport goods over short or long distances.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement mandates:
    * Minimum 12 months experience driving 7.5 Tonne vehicles (Cat C1).
    * Valid CPC and Digi tacho (certifications for professional truck drivers).
    * Ability to complete multi-drop runs.
    * No more than 6 penalty points on driving license.

    These requirements further solidify the match with **ISCO 8332**, as they are specific to professional heavy truck drivers.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**
    * **ISCO 8332** falls under:
        * Major Group 8: Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers.
        * Sub-major Group 83: Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators.

    This categorization accurately reflects the nature of the job, involving the operation of heavy vehicles for goods transportation.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8332
**ISCO Title:** Heavy truck and lorry drivers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and qualifications all strongly indicate that this position aligns perfectly with the ISCO unit for Heavy truck and lorry drivers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are necessary as the provided ISCO unit (8332) is a perfect match.

Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**
The job title is "Project Manager." This title is a common one used across various industries, so we need to look further into the description. The description emphasizes construction-related tasks such as managing budgets, schedules, and subcontractors, and ensuring adherence to building legislation. This suggests the job falls within the construction industry.

**Step 2: Review the main responsibilities and tasks.**
The job ad lists responsibilities like:
* Managing project delivery to a high standard.
* Budgeting and programming.
* Meeting company objectives post-contract.
* Ensuring projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality.

These responsibilities align strongly with the tasks described in the **ISCO unit 1323: Construction managers**.

**Step 3: Consider the required skills and qualifications.**
The job ad requires:
* A good track record of running similar projects with a value of up to £15m.
* A minimum of HNC/HND in an engineering-related discipline.
* A project management qualification.
* Team leadership and organizational skills.
* Ability to maintain relationships with internal and external stakeholders.

These requirements align with the skills and expertise expected of a **Construction manager (ISCO 1323)**.

**Step 4: Analyze the major, sub-major, and minor groups.**
* **ISCO 1323: Construction managers** falls under:
    * Major group **1: Managers**.
    * Sub-major group **13: Production and Specialized Services Managers**.

This categorization is consistent with the job's managerial nature within the construction industry.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1323
**ISCO Title:** Construction managers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on managing construction projects, aligning perfectly with the responsibilities, tasks, and required qualifications of a Construction Manager as defined by ISCO unit 1323. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

The provided ISCO unit 1323: Construction managers is a very strong match, making alternative predictions unnecessary.

Response:
## Job Advertisement Analysis: Õde Imastu hooldekodusse

**1. Translation and Initial Impression:**

* **English Translation:** Nurse for Imastu Nursing Home
* **Description Translation:** Patient counseling and nursing. Performing medical procedures and certain examinations. Nursing plan development.

The title and description immediately suggest a nursing role within a nursing home setting. 

**2.  Analyzing Potential ISCO Units:**

* **1343: Aged Care Services Managers:** While the setting is relevant, the described tasks focus on direct patient care, not management responsibilities like directing staff, managing budgets, or liaising with external bodies. This unit is not a good fit.

* **2221: Nursing Professionals:** This unit strongly aligns with the advertisement. The description emphasizes direct patient care (counseling, nursing, procedures), care planning, and potential for working within a team (mentioning "certain examinations" suggests collaboration). This is a strong contender.

* **2222: Midwifery Professionals:** This unit is irrelevant. The advertisement focuses on general nursing care, not pregnancy and childbirth.

* **2240: Paramedical Practitioners:**  While some tasks like "performing medical procedures" could overlap, the overall scope seems less complex than what's described for Paramedical Practitioners. The advertisement lacks emphasis on autonomous practice or advanced procedures typical of this unit.

* **3221: Nursing Associate Professionals:** This unit focuses on basic nursing care under supervision. The advertisement's mention of "performing medical procedures" and "nursing plan development" suggests a higher level of autonomy and expertise than typically associated with associate professionals.

* **Remaining ISCO Units:** The remaining units (3256, 3259, 5321, 5322, 5329) are even less relevant. They cover assistant roles, administrative tasks, or personal care, none of which align with the core responsibilities described.

**3. Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2221
**ISCO Title:** Nursing Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly emphasizes direct patient care, including nursing, counseling, procedures, and care planning, all core responsibilities of Nursing Professionals. The setting (nursing home) further supports this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3221, 2240, 1343 

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

While 2221 is the most likely fit, these alternatives are provided with decreasing confidence:

* **3221 (Nursing Associate Professionals):**  If the "medical procedures" are routine and under close supervision, this unit might be a possibility, though less likely given the "nursing plan development" responsibility. 
* **2240 (Paramedical Practitioners):** This is a distant possibility only if the "medical procedures" are quite advanced and the role involves significant autonomy, which is not clear from the advertisement.
* **1343 (Aged Care Services Managers):** This is highly unlikely unless the role unexpectedly combines direct care with substantial management duties, which is not indicated.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Experienced Occupational Therapist." This title is explicitly listed as an example occupation within the description of ISCO Code 2269: Other Health Professionals. 

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad emphasizes tasks like moving and handling risk assessments, providing advice and equipment to support independent living, assessing for home adaptations, and supervising students. These tasks align strongly with the description of occupational therapists within ISCO 2269.

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** The job requires a professional qualification in Occupational Therapy, registration with Social Work England as an Occupational Therapist, and experience working with adults in health or social care. This reinforces the suitability of ISCO 2269, which focuses on professionals with specialized qualifications.

4. **Evaluate the major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 2269 falls under Major Group 2: Professionals, Sub-major Group 22: Health Professionals. This categorization is a perfect match for the advertised position, confirming the job's professional status within the healthcare field.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2269
**ISCO Title:** Other Health Professionals
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required qualifications, and tasks all directly correspond with the definition and examples provided for ISCO 2269: Other Health Professionals. The emphasis on specialized knowledge, client interaction, and practical application within a healthcare setting solidifies this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO code is a perfect match, so no alternatives are needed.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "Panel Beater" is a strong indicator of the job's nature.  This title is directly listed as a "Similar job title" for ISCO code 7213: Sheet Metal Workers. 

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The description emphasizes repairing damaged vehicle panels to manufacturer specifications. This aligns strongly with the tasks described for Sheet Metal Workers, particularly the mention of "vehicle panel" work in the "Similar job titles".

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The requirement of being a "fully qualified Panel Beater" further supports the classification as a Sheet Metal Worker. While City & Guilds level qualifications are not specific to ISCO, they indicate a recognized level of formal training typical for this trade.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO code 7213 falls under:
    - **Major Group 7:** Craft and Related Trades Workers - This aligns perfectly with the hands-on, skilled nature of the job.
    - **Sub-major Group 72:** Metal, Machinery and Related Trades Workers -  The job explicitly involves working with metal vehicle panels.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7213
**ISCO Title:** Sheet Metal Workers
**Confidence:** 1.0 
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and industry all point definitively towards the ISCO unit for Sheet Metal Workers.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Refuse Collector". The description emphasizes collecting domestic refuse, walking long distances, and heavy lifting. 

2. **Compare with ISCO unit 9611 (Garbage collectors):** 
    * **Match:** The job title "Refuse Collector" is a direct match to the ISCO title and description. 
    * **Match:** The tasks described in the ad (collecting rubbish, emptying bins into trucks) perfectly align with the ISCO unit's tasks.
    * **Match:** The required skills (physical fitness, no experience needed) align with the ISCO unit's skill level (Elementary Occupations).

3. **Consider other ISCO units:**  While other units involve manual labor and some aspects might seem relevant, none are as direct a match as 9611. 
    * 9329 (Manufacturing labourers) is too broad and focuses on factory settings.
    * 9333 (Freight handlers) involves packing and handling various goods, not specifically refuse.
    * 9334 (Shelf fillers) focuses on stocking shelves in retail environments.
    * 9510 (Street and related services workers) involves providing services directly to people on the street.
    * 9612 (Refuse sorters) focuses on sorting recyclable materials, not initial collection.
    * 9613 (Sweepers and related labourers) focuses on cleaning public areas, not collecting refuse.
    * 9623 (Meter readers and vending-machine collectors) involves collecting money and data, not refuse.
    * 9624 (Water and firewood collectors) is not relevant to the job ad.
    * 4214 (Debt collectors and related workers) involves collecting money from debtors, not refuse.

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 9611
**ISCO Title:** Garbage collectors
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:**  The job title, description, tasks, and required skills in the advertisement directly and unambiguously match the ISCO unit 9611 (Garbage collectors).

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No other provided ISCO unit is a close enough match to be considered a viable alternative.

## Job Advertisement Analysis:

Here's a breakdown of the job advertisement, translated into English:

**Title:** Insurance Agent

**Description:**

We can offer you a clearly defined career path and the support of more experienced people. We provide a high salary based on a commission system, plus attractive bonuses and competitions with prizes. You can develop by participating in free training courses. 

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **ISCO Code 3321: Insurance representatives** appears to be the most relevant based on the job title ("Insurance Agent") and the core responsibilities described (selling insurance, advising clients, explaining policies). 

2. The required skills like knowledge of the insurance market, client relationship building, and sales skills align strongly with the description of Insurance representatives.

3. The job ad emphasizes active client acquisition, which is a key task listed under ISCO 3321.

4. While a KNF license is preferred, not required, suggesting the role might involve aspects of insurance sales that don't necessitate a full license, aligning with the broader scope of "Insurance representatives."

5. Other potential ISCO codes are less relevant:
    - **2422 (Policy administration professionals)** focuses on policy development and analysis, not direct sales or client interaction.
    - **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals)** deals with HR functions, not insurance sales.
    - **3315 (Valuers and loss assessors)** assess property and losses, a different domain.
    - **3331 (Employment agents and contractors)** focus on job placement, not insurance.
    - **3333 (Real estate agents and property managers)** handle real estate transactions.
    - **3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified)** is too broad and doesn't specifically address insurance sales.
    - **4229 (Client information workers not elsewhere classified)** and **4312 (Statistical, finance and insurance clerks)** are primarily clerical roles with less emphasis on sales and client interaction.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3321
**ISCO Title:** Insurance representatives
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement strongly aligns with the tasks, skills, and responsibilities outlined for Insurance representatives (ISCO 3321). The focus on active client acquisition, insurance product knowledge, and sales-oriented responsibilities makes this the most appropriate classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO code 3321 is a strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

## Job Advertisement Analysis:

**Translated Title:** Waiter / Waitress for Germany
**Translated Description:** Waiter / Waitress for Germany. Waiter / Waitress in Germany. Description and requirements: Waiter/waitress for a high-class hotel in Germany, Munich. Requirements: - Good spoken German...

## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Job Title and Description:** The title clearly indicates a "Waiter/Waitress" position. This directly matches the "Similar job titles" listed under ISCO unit **5131: Waiters**. 
2. **Main Responsibilities:** While the description is limited, the context of a "high-class hotel" suggests typical waiter/waitress duties such as taking orders, serving food and beverages, and providing customer service.
3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The only mentioned requirement is "Good spoken German," essential for communication in a German hotel. This aligns with the customer-facing nature of a waiter/waitress role.
4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**  ISCO unit 5131 falls under:
    - **Major Group 5: Services And Sales Workers** - This accurately reflects the service-oriented nature of the job.
    - **Sub-major Group 51: Personal Services Workers** - This further specifies the type of service provided, aligning with a waiter/waitress role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5131
**ISCO Title:** Waiters
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, context, and limited description strongly suggest a waiter/waitress position, directly matching ISCO unit 5131. The required German language skill further supports this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

**Note:** While the advertisement lacks detail, the available information provides a high level of confidence in the 5131 classification. There is no compelling reason to consider alternative ISCO units.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals)**: While the job involves sales, it's focused on real estate, not industrial, medical, or pharmaceutical goods. The tasks don't align with this ISCO unit. 
2. **ISCO 2434 (Information and communications technology (ICT) sales professionals)**: This is not a good fit as the job advertisement clearly focuses on real estate, not ICT products.
3. **ISCO 3322 (Commercial sales representatives)**: This unit is closer but still not specific enough. While the job involves selling commercial properties, real estate has its own set of tasks and regulations. 
4. **ISCO 3323 (Buyers)**: This unit focuses on purchasing goods and services, not selling them. The job ad clearly describes a sales role.
5. **ISCO 3324 (Trade brokers)**: This unit deals with commodities and shipping services, not real estate. 
6. **ISCO 3333 (Employment agents and contractors)**: This unit focuses on matching job seekers with employers, not real estate sales.
7. **ISCO 3334 (Real estate agents and property managers)**: This unit aligns perfectly with the job advertisement. The tasks, responsibilities, and required skills all fall under the scope of a real estate agent, specifically focusing on commercial sales.
8. **ISCO 3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified)**: While this unit covers a broad range of agents, the specific tasks and responsibilities of a real estate agent are better represented by ISCO 3334. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3334
**ISCO Title:** Real estate agents and property managers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a Real Estate Commercial Sales Specialist, aligning perfectly with the tasks, skills, and responsibilities outlined in ISCO 3334.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Server".  This title is directly listed as a similar job title for ISCO code 5131: Waiters.

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The job description emphasizes customer interaction ("making customers and their colleagues' days better", "deliver excellent service"), taking orders, and serving. These tasks align strongly with the description of Waiters. 

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The ad emphasizes personality traits like being outgoing and positive. While important, these are not specific skills that would point away from the "Waiter" classification. The ad also states that no prior experience is needed, suggesting an entry-level position, which aligns with the skill level of "Waiters".

4. **Major/Sub-major Groups:** ISCO code 5131 falls under Major group 5: Services and Sales Workers, and Sub-major group 51: Personal Services Workers. This aligns perfectly with the nature of the job advertised.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5131
**ISCO Title:** Waiters
**Confidence:** 1.0

## Job Advertisement Analysis: ANYAGMOZGATÓ

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation and Summary:**

* **Title:** Material Handler 
* **Description:** The job involves material handling using forklift (vezető üléses targoncával) and manual (gyalogkísérletű) methods in a metal production facility (FÉMALK Zrt., a company producing aluminum castings). 

**2. Matching with Potential ISCO Units:**

* **8112 - Mineral and stone processing plant operators:** This unit is not a good fit. The job involves metal production, not mineral or stone processing. 
* **7223 - Metal working machine tool setters and operators:** This unit is not a good fit. The job focuses on material handling, not operating or setting machine tools for metal working.
* **8121 - Metal processing plant operators:** This unit is also not a good fit. While the job is in a metal processing plant, the responsibilities are limited to material handling, not operating processing machinery.
* **8341 - Mobile farm and forestry plant operators:** This unit is not relevant. The job is in a factory setting, not related to agriculture or forestry.
* **8342 - Earthmoving and related plant operators:** This unit is not relevant. The job doesn't involve earthmoving or related tasks.
* **8343 - Crane, hoist and related plant operators:** This unit is not a good fit. The job description specifically mentions forklifts, not cranes or hoists.
* **8344 - Lifting truck operators:** This unit seems like the **best fit**. The job description explicitly mentions operating a forklift (vezető üléses targoncával), which is the primary responsibility of this ISCO unit.
* **9329 - Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified:** This unit could be a **possible fit** if the "manual" material handling aspect is significant. However, the specific mention of forklift operation makes 8344 a more accurate primary choice.
* **9333 - Freight handlers:** This unit is less specific than 8344. While material handling is involved, the factory setting and forklift operation make 8344 a more precise match.

**3. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
* **ISCO Title:** Lifting truck operators
* **Confidence:** 0.8 
* **Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly mentions operating a forklift, which is the core responsibility of Lifting truck operators. The industrial setting and material handling focus further support this classification.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 9329, 9333, 7223 

**Explanation of Alternative Codes:**

* **9329 - Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified:**  This is a viable alternative if the manual handling tasks are substantial and the forklift operation is a smaller part of the job.
* **9333 - Freight handlers:** This is less specific but could be considered if the material handling involves loading/unloading trucks in addition to internal transport.
* **7223 - Metal working machine tool setters and operators:** This is less likely but could be relevant if the role involves assisting machine operators with material handling in close proximity to the metal working processes.

* **Match:** Excellent match.

**10. ISCO Code 3339: Business services agents not elsewhere classified**

* **Reasoning:** While this is a broad category, the specific tasks and responsibilities listed in the job advertisement align much more closely with the Real estate agents and property managers unit. 
* **Match:** Not the best match.

**ISCO Title:** Real estate agents and property managers
**Confidence:** 1.0

## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Experienced & Talented Front-End Developer" clearly points towards a role focused on software development, specifically front-end development. This aligns with the descriptions of ISCO units related to software development (2512, 2513, 2514, 2519) more than design-focused units like 2166. 

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad emphasizes tasks like building digital services, designing and implementing front-end solutions, working with front-end technologies (LESS, Angular), and collaborating with back-end teams. These responsibilities closely match the tasks described for **Software Developers (2512)** and **Web and multimedia development professionals (2513)**.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The required skills listed (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Microservice Architectures, Cloud Environments, DevOps) are all core competencies of **Web and multimedia development professionals (2513)**. While **Software Developers (2512)** share some of these skills, the emphasis on front-end specific technologies like LESS and Angular makes 2513 a closer fit.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** Both 2512 and 2513 fall under the "Information and Communications Technology Professionals" sub-major group, which is appropriate for this job. However, the specific tasks and technologies mentioned in the ad align more strongly with the "Web and multimedia development professionals" minor group (2513).

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2513
**ISCO Title:** Web and multimedia development professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on front-end development, requiring expertise in technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, LESS, and Angular. This aligns strongly with the tasks, skills, and descriptions associated with ISCO unit 2513: Web and multimedia development professionals.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2512, 2514, 2519

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Hydrogeologist." This title is explicitly listed as a "Similar job title" within the description of ISCO unit **2114: Geologists and Geophysicists**. 

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The job description mentions tasks like "Model groundwater" and "Assess groundwater environmental impact." These tasks align strongly with the responsibilities of a Hydrogeologist, who focuses on the distribution and movement of groundwater. This further supports the initial assessment of **2114** as a potential fit.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement emphasizes skills like "Drive for Results" and "Customer Focus." While these are valuable in many professions, they don't contradict the core technical skills expected of a Hydrogeologist. The requirement of experience in a similar role also points towards a specialized profession like Hydrogeology.

4. **Major/Sub-major Groups:** ISCO unit **2114** falls under Major Group **2: Professionals** and Sub-major Group **21: Science and Engineering Professionals**. This aligns perfectly with the scientific and analytical nature of a Hydrogeologist's work.

5. **Eliminating Other Options:**  While some other ISCO units might appear tangentially related, they don't fit as accurately as 2114. For instance:
    * **2133: Environmental Protection Professionals** might deal with groundwater contamination, but their focus is broader than the specialized study of groundwater itself.
    * **2142: Civil Engineers** might work on projects involving groundwater, but their expertise lies in design and construction, not the scientific analysis of groundwater systems.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2114
**ISCO Title:** Geologists and Geophysicists
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title explicitly mentions "Hydrogeologist," a profession directly listed under ISCO 2114. The job description further confirms this by focusing on tasks directly related to groundwater assessment and modeling. The required skills and experience align with the expectations of a scientific professional in this field.

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3434
**ISCO Title:** Chefs
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** This job advertisement heavily emphasizes culinary skills and experience, menu planning, and kitchen management, aligning strongly with the Chef role. The title "Grill Room Chef" further suggests a specialization within the culinary field. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 5120, 1412, 1411

## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the Job Title and Description:**
    - The title "Grill Room Chef" immediately points towards a culinary role. 
    - The description emphasizes leading and motivating a team, indicating a supervisory position within the kitchen.

2. **Evaluating Main Responsibilities and Tasks:**
    - "Hands-on working chef" suggests direct involvement in food preparation.
    - Responsibilities like "restaurant operations, catering, standardized recipes, cost control, and inventory" align with the tasks of a head chef.

3. **Assessing Required Skills and Qualifications:**
    - "Culinary excellence," "keen eye for detail," and required culinary experience all point towards a skilled culinary professional.
    - Leadership skills are essential, reinforcing the managerial aspect of the role.

4. **Examining ISCO Units:**
    - **1411 (Hotel managers):** While this role involves managing a team within a country club (which might have lodging facilities), the core focus is on the culinary aspect, not overall hotel management.
    - **1412 (Restaurant managers):** This is a close match, as the role involves managing a restaurant-like setting. However, the hands-on cooking aspect and emphasis on culinary skills make the Chef classification more accurate.
    - **3434 (Chefs):** This is the most fitting category. The job description aligns perfectly with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for Chefs, including menu planning, food preparation, staff supervision, and quality control. 
    - **5120 (Cooks):** While cooking is a significant part of the job, the managerial responsibilities and required leadership skills elevate this role beyond a typical Cook. 

5. **Alternative ISCO Codes:**
    - **5120 (Cooks):**  If the leadership and management aspects were less emphasized, this could be a potential fit.
    - **1412 (Restaurant managers):**  If the job description focused more on the business side of the grill room and less on the hands-on cooking, this code would be more appropriate.
    - **1411 (Hotel managers):** This is the least likely alternative, only applicable if the Grill Room Chef had significant responsibilities beyond the grill room itself, encompassing broader aspects of the country club's operations.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Software Project Manager." This points towards a managerial role within the IT sector.  The description emphasizes managing software projects, coordinating teams, and using agile methodologies.

2. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1212 (Human Resource Managers):** This code is not a match. The job ad focuses on IT project management, not HR functions like recruitment, training, or employee relations.

3. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1213 (Policy and Planning Managers):** This code is also not a match. The role is operational, focusing on delivering software projects, not on high-level policy or strategic planning.

4. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1219 (Business Services and Administration Managers):** This code is a poor match. While some administrative tasks are involved, the core responsibilities revolve around software development lifecycles, not general business services or administration.

5. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1223 (Research and Development Managers):** This code is not a match. The job description emphasizes managing the project lifecycle of existing software development, not conducting research or developing new technologies.

6. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1311 (Agricultural and Forestry Production Managers):** This code is completely irrelevant to the job advertisement, as it focuses on agricultural practices.

7. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1330 (Information and Communications Technology Services Managers):** This code seems relevant but is not the best fit. While it involves managing IT services, the job description emphasizes project management within software development, not overseeing an entire IT department or infrastructure.

8. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1344 (Social Welfare Managers):** This code is entirely unrelated to the job advertisement.

9. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1349 (Professional Services Managers):** This code is too broad and doesn't specifically address the core responsibilities of a Software Project Manager.

10. **Evaluate ISCO Code 1431 (Sports, Recreation and Cultural Centre Managers):** This code is completely irrelevant to the job advertisement.

11. **Evaluate ISCO Code 2512 (Software Developers):** This code is a strong contender. While titled "Software Developers," the description includes tasks like analyzing requirements, designing, developing, and testing software, which aligns with the project management aspects described in the job ad. However, it lacks the managerial focus on leading teams and coordinating with stakeholders.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1330 
**ISCO Title:** Information and Communications Technology Services Managers
**Confidence:** 0.7 
**Reasoning:** This code best reflects the job's core responsibilities, even though it doesn't perfectly encapsulate the project management focus. The job involves working closely with software development teams, understanding technical requirements, and ensuring project delivery – all falling under the broader scope of managing ICT services.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2512, 1219, 1349

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **2512 (Software Developers):** This code captures the technical understanding and involvement in the software development lifecycle required for the role.
* **1219 (Business Services and Administration Managers):**  This code acknowledges the administrative and coordination tasks inherent in project management.
* **1349 (Professional Services Managers):** This code serves as a broader category encompassing the management of specialized professionals, which could include software development teams.

Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**
The job title is "Physical Therapist Assistant." This title is explicitly listed as a "similar job title" in the description of ISCO unit **3255: Physiotherapy Technicians and Assistants**. 

**Step 2: Analyze the main responsibilities and tasks.**
The job advertisement lists responsibilities such as:
* Performing data collection
* Applying knowledge to restore function and prevent injury
* Adhering to ethical and legal standards
* Completing documentation
* Hands-on experience with therapeutic exercises and modalities

These responsibilities align strongly with the tasks described for ISCO unit **3255**, which include administering physical therapies, instructing patients, monitoring progress, and working under the supervision of a physiotherapist.

**Step 3: Analyze the required skills and qualifications.**
The job ad requires:
* Proven experience as a physical therapist assistant
* Knowledge of physiology and best practices
* Communication and instruction skills
* Healthcare administration and documentation skills

These skills match the description of ISCO unit **3255**, which requires knowledge of physical therapy techniques, patient interaction, and record-keeping.

**Step 4: Analyze the major, sub-major, and minor groups.**
ISCO unit **3255** falls under:
* Major group **3**: Technicians and Associate Professionals
* Sub-major group **32**: Health Associate Professionals

This classification accurately reflects the position of a Physical Therapist Assistant, who provides skilled support in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a professional (Physiotherapist).

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3255
**ISCO Title:** Physiotherapy Technicians and Assistants
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, responsibilities, required skills, and required qualifications all strongly align with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 3255.

Job Ad ID: 837186398, Row: 25642, Pred: 4311, 3313, 4313, 2411, 4416, 5221, 4132, 5152, 4211, 4110
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2411 (Accountants):** While the job mentions tax preparation, the overall description emphasizes setting up and maintaining a bookkeeping system, not the higher-level analysis and financial advising typical of an Accountant. This suggests a lower skill level than ISCO 2411. 

2. **ISCO 3313 (Accounting Associate Professionals):** This unit explicitly lists "Bookkeeper" as an example occupation and aligns well with the job description. The tasks of maintaining financial records, verifying accuracy, and potentially using accounting software all fall under this category.

3. **ISCO 4110 (General Office Clerks):** This unit is too general. While a bookkeeper might perform some clerical tasks, their primary role is financial record-keeping, which is more specialized than the tasks listed in this unit.

4. **The remaining ISCO units (4132, 4211, 4311, 4313, 4416, 5152, 5221)** are even less relevant. They focus on data entry, bank telling, payroll, personnel, housekeeping, and shopkeeping, none of which align with the core responsibilities of a bookkeeper.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3313
**ISCO Title:** Accounting Associate Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job description explicitly mentions "Bookkeeper" and focuses on tasks like setting up a bookkeeping system, maintaining financial records, and preparing taxes, aligning strongly with the definition and tasks of ISCO 3313.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 4311, 2411, N/A 

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

* **4311 (Accounting and Bookkeeping Clerks):**  While less specific to the "setting up" aspect, this unit covers the routine tasks of bookkeeping and could be considered if 3313 wasn't a close match.
* **2411 (Accountants):**  If the job description included more emphasis on financial analysis, advising, or complex tax preparation, this unit might be a better fit. However, the current description points to a more operational bookkeeping role. 
* **N/A:** The remaining ISCO units are too distant in focus to be considered as alternatives.

Response:
## Reasoning Process:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Real Estate Negotiator". This immediately points towards ISCO unit **3334: Real estate agents and property managers**, as "Estate agent" and "Realtor" are listed as examples of occupations within this unit.

2. **Task and Responsibility Analysis:** The job advertisement lists tasks such as:
    * Searching and evaluating properties
    * Promoting properties to potential buyers
    * Conducting viewings
    * Managing client portfolios
    * Negotiating sales and financing
    * Ensuring customer satisfaction

    These tasks align strongly with the description of ISCO unit **3334**, which includes arranging sales, purchases, rentals, and leases of real estate, showing properties, facilitating negotiations, and drawing up agreements.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement emphasizes skills like negotiation, prospecting, real estate law, financing, and customer service. These are all core competencies for real estate agents and property managers, further supporting the classification of **3334**.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO unit **3334** falls under:
    * Major group **3**: Technicians and Associate Professionals
    * Sub-major group **33**: Business and Administration Associate Professionals
    * Minor group **333**: Business Services Agents

    This classification accurately reflects the professional nature of the job, its focus on business and administration within the real estate sector.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3334
**ISCO Title:** Real estate agents and property managers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, tasks, required skills, and overall job description strongly align with the definition and characteristics of ISCO unit 3334.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO unit perfectly matches the job advertisement, so no alternative codes are needed.

Job Ad ID: 843556979, Row: 25640, Pred: 2310, 2633, 3411, 2619, 3342, 2353, 1345, 2611, 2359, 2632
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 1345 (Education managers)**: While the job involves working within a university, the advertised role focuses on teaching and research, not managing educational programs or administrative aspects. The job title "Faculty position" and responsibilities align more with a teaching role than a managerial one. Therefore, this ISCO unit is not the best fit.

2. **ISCO 2310 (University and higher education teachers)**: This unit aligns strongly with the job advertisement. The title explicitly mentions "Faculty position" and the description emphasizes teaching and research responsibilities, typical for university-level educators. The required qualifications like PhD and teaching experience further confirm this match. 

3. **ISCO 2353 (Other language teachers)**: This unit focuses on teaching languages to non-native speakers, which is not the primary focus of the advertised position. While language proficiency (Spanish, Catalan, English) is desired, it's meant to facilitate teaching law and international relations, not to teach the languages themselves. Therefore, this ISCO unit is not a good fit.

4. **ISCO 2359 (Teaching professionals not elsewhere classified)**: This unit encompasses teaching roles outside typical educational settings. While the UOC employs a unique distance learning model, it's still a recognized university, and the position falls under their established faculty structure.  Therefore, this broader category is less accurate than the specific ISCO 2310.

5. **ISCO 2611 (Lawyers)**:  The advertised position requires expertise in law and international relations, but it focuses on teaching and research, not providing legal advice or representing clients, which are core duties of lawyers. Thus, this ISCO unit is not suitable.

6. **ISCO 2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified)**:  Similar to ISCO 2611, this unit involves legal expertise but in roles different from practicing law. The advertised position's focus on academia makes this unit a mismatch.

7. **ISCO 2632 (Sociologists, anthropologists and related professionals)**: While international relations touch upon societal structures, this ISCO unit is too broad. The core focus on law, teaching, and research within a university setting makes this unit less accurate.

8. **ISCO 2633 (Philosophers, historians and political scientists)**:  This unit shares some similarities as the job requires knowledge of political science and international relations. However, the primary focus on law and the teaching aspect makes ISCO 2310 a more precise match.

9. **ISCO 3342 (Legal secretaries)**: This unit involves administrative and secretarial tasks in legal settings. The advertised position requires a PhD and emphasizes teaching and research, making it a completely different skillset and responsibility level.

10. **ISCO 3411 (Legal and related associate professionals)**: Similar to ISCO 3342, this unit focuses on support roles within the legal field. The advertised position's requirements and responsibilities are far more aligned with a teaching and research-oriented academic role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2310
**ISCO Title:** University and higher education teachers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly outlines a faculty position at a university, emphasizing teaching and research in law and international relations. This aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO 2310.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2633, 2359, 2632

Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the Job Title and Description**

The job title is "Bench Joiner / Carpenter." This title directly matches the "Similar job titles" listed in ISCO unit **7115: Carpenters and Joiners**. 

**Step 2: Analyze Responsibilities and Tasks**

The job advertisement lists the following responsibilities:

* Cutting to specifications
* Assembly of products
* Ensuring items are finished to a high quality
* Using a variety of tooling

These tasks align strongly with the description of **7115: Carpenters and Joiners**, which includes tasks like cutting, shaping, assembling, erecting, maintaining, and repairing wood structures and fittings.

**Step 3: Analyze Required Skills and Qualifications**

The job ad requires at least 2 years of relevant experience, preferably with experience working with doors and door frames. This experience requirement aligns with the skill level of **7115: Carpenters and Joiners**, which is categorized as "Skill Level 2 (medium)".

**Step 4: Analyze Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups**

ISCO unit **7115: Carpenters and Joiners** falls under:

* Major Group 7: Craft and Related Trades Workers
* Sub-major Group 71: Building and Related Trades Workers (excluding Electricians)

This categorization is a logical fit for the advertised position.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 7115
* **ISCO Title:** Carpenters and Joiners
* **Confidence:** 1.0 
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, required experience, and industry all align perfectly with the ISCO unit for Carpenters and Joiners. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as the primary prediction has high confidence.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the job advertisement:** The job title is "UI Designer," and the description emphasizes creating user interfaces for digital products. The role involves visual design, user experience (UX) considerations, and collaboration with product and engineering teams.

2. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2161 (Building architects):** This code is immediately irrelevant. The job ad focuses on digital UI design, not physical buildings.

3. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2163 (Product and garment designers):** While this code involves design, it focuses on physical products and manufacturing processes. The UI Designer role is firmly situated in the digital realm, making this code unsuitable.

4. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2166 (Graphic and multimedia designers):** This code holds promise. It includes designing visual content for digital media, aligning with the UI Designer's responsibilities. The tasks listed, such as creating visuals, animations, and collaborating with other teams, are strong indicators of a match.

5. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2512 (Software developers):** This code focuses on the technical aspects of software creation. While a UI Designer needs some technical understanding, their primary role is visual design and user experience, not software development. 

6. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals):** This code is also relevant. UI design is integral to web and multimedia development. The job ad mentions "user flows" and "site maps," hinting at a potential overlap with web development tasks. However, the emphasis on visual design and user experience aligns more strongly with 2166.

7. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2521 (Database designers and administrators):** This code is entirely unrelated to UI design. It focuses on data management and backend systems.

8. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2651 (Visual artists):** While UI design involves visual creativity, this code is too broad. It encompasses traditional art forms, while the UI Designer role is specifically about designing for digital interfaces.

9. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3118 (Draughtspersons):** This code focuses on technical drawings and illustrations, often for manufacturing or construction. It lacks the digital and user-centered focus of UI design.

10. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3432 (Interior designers and decorators):** This code deals with physical spaces, not digital interfaces. While aesthetics are important to both, the core skills and knowledge bases are distinct.

11. **Evaluating ISCO Code 7316 (Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers):** This code is irrelevant, focusing on manual and artistic crafts unrelated to digital UI design.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2166
**ISCO Title:** Graphic and multimedia designers
**Confidence:** 0.85
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement strongly emphasizes visual design, user experience, and creating interfaces for digital products. These aspects align most closely with the tasks and skills associated with Graphic and multimedia designers. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2513, 2651, 3432

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

* **2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals):**  While not the primary focus, the job ad hints at potential overlap with web development tasks.
* **2651 (Visual artists):** UI design requires visual creativity, making this a very broad alternative.
* **3432 (Interior designers and decorators):**  Aesthetics are important to both fields, but the contexts and skillsets differ significantly.

Response:
**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "New Build Solicitor," and the description emphasizes legal work in residential conveyancing, specifically for new-build properties. This points towards a legal professional role.

2. **Review ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers):** This unit aligns well with the job description. The tasks listed in the ISCO unit description, such as giving legal advice, drafting legal documents (contracts in this case), and representing clients, are all relevant to a New Build Solicitor.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:**
    * **1323 (Construction managers):** While the job involves new builds, the solicitor's role is legal, not managerial in the construction process.
    * **2161 (Building architects):** This is not relevant as the job focuses on legal aspects, not design.
    * **2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** This is too broad. ISCO 2611 is a more specific and accurate match.
    * **3123 (Construction supervisors):**  Not relevant, as the role doesn't involve supervising construction work.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** This unit includes roles like conveyancing clerks, who often work under the supervision of solicitors. The job ad requires a qualified solicitor with at least 2 years of experience, indicating a higher level of expertise and autonomy than typically associated with legal associate professionals.
    * **7111 (House builders), 7121 (Roofers), 7411 (Building and related electricians), 9313 (Building construction labourers):** These are all trades and labor roles and completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
* **ISCO Title:** Lawyers 
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly describes a legal professional specializing in residential conveyancing for new-build properties. The required qualifications and responsibilities align perfectly with the ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers). 
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as 2611 is a strong and accurate match.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2412 (Financial and investment advisers):** While the job mentions insurance, the core responsibilities revolve around providing legal advice, not financial planning or investment strategies. This unit is not a good fit.

2. **ISCO 2422 (Policy administration professionals):** This unit focuses on developing and analyzing policies for government or commercial operations. The Legal Advisor role is about applying and interpreting existing law, not creating new policies. This unit is not a good fit.

3. **ISCO 2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):** This unit deals with HR functions like recruitment, training, and employee relations. The Legal Advisor role has no relation to these tasks. This unit is not a good fit.

4. **ISCO 2611 (Lawyers):** This unit perfectly aligns with the job description. The Legal Advisor will provide legal advice, interpret law, manage litigation, review contracts, and research legal matters – all core tasks of a lawyer. This unit is a strong match.

5. **ISCO 2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** While this unit covers legal professionals, it focuses on those *not* primarily engaged in pleading cases or legal representation. The Legal Advisor role explicitly involves litigation and legal advice, making ISCO 2611 a more specific and accurate fit.

6. **ISCO 3315 (Valuers and loss assessors):** This unit deals with assessing the value of property and losses for insurance purposes. While relevant to the insurance industry, the Legal Advisor's role is distinct and focuses on legal matters, not valuation. This unit is not a good fit.

7. **ISCO 3321 (Insurance representatives):** This unit focuses on selling and advising on insurance policies. The Legal Advisor role is about providing internal legal support, not directly interacting with customers or selling insurance. This unit is not a good fit.

8. **ISCO 3331 (Clearing and forwarding agents):** This unit deals with customs clearance and import/export procedures. This is unrelated to the Legal Advisor's responsibilities. This unit is not a good fit.

9. **ISCO 3342 (Legal secretaries):** This unit involves secretarial and administrative support in legal settings. While the Legal Advisor may delegate some tasks, their role requires a higher level of legal expertise and autonomy than a legal secretary. This unit is not a good fit.

10. **ISCO 3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** This unit encompasses various legal support roles, including paralegals and legal assistants. While there's some overlap with the Legal Advisor's tasks, the advertised position requires an admitted attorney with significant experience, indicating a higher level of responsibility and decision-making authority than typically associated with this unit. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
**ISCO Title:** Lawyers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job description explicitly seeks an "Admitted Attorney" and outlines responsibilities directly aligned with the core tasks of a lawyer, such as providing legal advice, managing litigation, and reviewing contracts. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3411, 2619, 3342 

While ISCO 2611 is the most accurate fit, there's a slight chance the role might involve a blend of legal advisory and more hands-on legal support, potentially aligning with ISCO 3411. However, the requirement for an admitted attorney with 3-5 years of experience strongly suggests a more senior and autonomous role, making ISCO 2611 the most likely match.

## ISCO Code Prediction:

**Step 1: Analyzing the Job Advertisement:**

* **Job Title:** Transport/Import Administrator 
* **Main Responsibilities:**
    * Processing customer orders and inquiries.
    * Managing import/export records.
    * Using SAP software.
    * Creating invoices.
    * Processing shipments, obtaining documents, and arranging deliveries.
* **Required Skills:**
    * Administrative experience.
    * Self-starter, able to work independently.
    * Experience with import processes, transport booking, and customs (beneficial).
    * Strong written and verbal communication skills.
    * Attention to detail.

**Step 2: Evaluating Potential ISCO Units:**

1. **ISCO 1324: Supply, distribution and related managers:** While the job involves logistics, the title "Administrator" and the lack of managerial responsibilities (planning, directing, coordinating) make this unit less suitable.

2. **ISCO 3324: Trade brokers:** This unit focuses on buying and selling commodities and shipping services, which doesn't align with the administrative tasks described in the advertisement.

3. **ISCO 3331: Clearing and forwarding agents:** This unit aligns well with the job description, particularly tasks like handling import/export documentation, ensuring compliance, and obtaining necessary licenses. 

4. **ISCO 3351: Customs and border inspectors:** This unit involves border control and inspection, which is not relevant to the job advertisement.

5. **ISCO 4120: Secretaries (general):** This unit is too general and doesn't encompass the specialized tasks related to transport and import processes.

6. **ISCO 4321: Stock clerks:** This unit focuses on inventory management and stock control, which is only a small part of the advertised role.

7. **ISCO 4323: Transport clerks:** This unit aligns well with the job description, involving tasks like coordinating transport, handling documentation, and managing operational aspects of logistics.

8. **ISCO 8332: Heavy truck and lorry drivers:** This unit involves driving and operating heavy vehicles, which is not relevant to the job advertisement.

9. **ISCO 8344: Lifting truck operators:** This unit involves operating lifting trucks for moving goods, which is not relevant to the job advertisement.

10. **ISCO 9333: Freight handlers:** This unit involves manual handling of freight, which is not mentioned in the job advertisement.

**Step 3: Final Prediction and Reasoning:**

**ISCO Code (unit): 4323**
**ISCO Title: Transport clerks**
**Confidence: 0.8**
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement emphasizes administrative tasks within a transport and import context. The responsibilities closely match those of Transport Clerks, including coordinating deliveries, handling shipping documents, and managing import/export records. The required skills like communication, attention to detail, and experience with import processes further support this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 3331, 4321, 4120**

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **3331: Clearing and forwarding agents:** This unit remains a close alternative due to the focus on import/export procedures and documentation. However, the "Administrator" title suggests a less specialized role than a dedicated Clearing and Forwarding Agent.
* **4321: Stock clerks:** While inventory management is only a small part of the advertised role, the tasks related to SAP and maintaining import/export records could potentially fall under the scope of a Stock Clerk.
* **4120: Secretaries (general):** This unit serves as a broader alternative if the specialized aspects of the role are less emphasized. The administrative and communication skills required could be applicable in a general secretarial position.

    * **7212 - Welders and flame cutters:** This unit focuses on joining and cutting metal using various heat sources. While a blacksmith might use these techniques, their primary skill set revolves around shaping metal through forging.
    * **7221 - Blacksmiths, hammersmiths and forging press workers:** This unit perfectly aligns with the job title and description. It explicitly mentions hammering and forging metal to create tools, articles, and equipment, aligning with the advertised responsibilities of die forging and open die forging.

2. **Matching the job ad:**
    * The job title "Blacksmith" directly corresponds to ISCO unit 7221.
    * The description explicitly mentions "die forging and open die forging" and "operation of hammers," which are core tasks listed under ISCO unit 7221.

## Final Prediction:

## Job Advertisement Analysis:

**English Translation:**

**Title:** Security Guard
**Description:** Security Guard. Security Guard. We are looking for employees for the security of the Lidl Vlašim store. Requirements: Security guard certificate - can be trained, clean criminal record, age from 18 years, experience in security is an advantage - not a condition, reliability. Work suitable also for people with disabilities. We offer: adequate salary from 20 thousand CZK / month, work in a strong company, bonuses, advance payments. Immediate start.

## Reasoning Process:

1. **Analyzing the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance:**
    * **110 & 210 & 310 (Armed Forces Occupations):** These are immediately ruled out. The job advertisement clearly states "security of the Lidl Vlašim store," indicating a civilian security role, not military.
    * **5412 (Police Officers):** This is not a suitable match. Police officers have broader law enforcement authority. The advertisement focuses on guarding a specific property.
    * **5413 (Prison Guards):** This is not applicable. The job is for a store, not a prison.
    * **5414 (Security Guards):** This appears to be the **most fitting ISCO unit**. The job description aligns with the tasks of a security guard: patrolling premises, deterring theft, controlling access.
    * **5419 (Protective Services Workers Not Elsewhere Classified):** While this category includes some security-related roles, it's too broad. 5414 is a more specific and accurate match.
    * **9334 (Shelf Fillers):** This is completely unrelated to security work and can be ruled out. 
    * **9510 (Street and Related Services Workers):**  Not relevant. This involves public services, not private property security.
    * **9622 (Odd-job Persons):** This is too general. While a handyman might do minor repairs, it doesn't encompass the core duties of a security guard.

2. **Confirming the best fit:** ISCO unit **5414 (Security Guards)** aligns strongly with the job advertisement. The title, description, and listed tasks (ostraha/security) all point to this being the most appropriate classification.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5414
**ISCO Title:** Security Guards
**Confidence:** 0.95 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a security guard position for a retail store, aligning with the tasks and responsibilities outlined in ISCO unit 5414. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 5419, 5412, 3355 (Police Inspectors and Detectives - if the role involved more internal investigations)

Response:
The provided job advertisement does not contain enough information to confidently assign an ISCO code. The advertisement is for a position titled "Advanced Practitioner - Teaching, Learning & Assessment," but the body of the advertisement is missing. 

**Reasoning:**

Without a detailed job description outlining the responsibilities, tasks, required skills, and qualifications, it is impossible to accurately determine the most appropriate ISCO unit. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes:**

Based on the limited information available in the job title, here are three potentially relevant ISCO codes:

1. **ISCO Code:** 2351
   **ISCO Title:** Education methods specialists 
   **Reasoning:**  The title "Advanced Practitioner - Teaching, Learning & Assessment" suggests a role focused on pedagogical practices and potentially curriculum development, aligning with the description of Education methods specialists. 

2. **ISCO Code:** 1345
   **ISCO Title:** Education managers
   **Reasoning:** The term "Advanced Practitioner" could imply a leadership role within an educational institution. Depending on the specific responsibilities, this position might involve managing educational programs and staff.

3. **ISCO Code:** 2359
   **ISCO Title:** Other teaching professionals
   **Reasoning:** This is a broad category that encompasses various teaching roles not classified elsewhere. If the "Advanced Practitioner" focuses on specialized instruction or student support outside traditional teaching roles, this code might be appropriate. 

**Final Prediction:**

Due to insufficient information, a confident prediction cannot be made. Further details about the job responsibilities are needed for accurate ISCO code assignment.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "Inżynier Elektryk" translates directly to "Electrical Engineer". This strongly suggests ISCO unit **2151: Electrical Engineers**.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job advertisement emphasizes:
    * **Maintenance and Repair:** "Performing konserwacji i przeglądów" (maintenance and inspections), "wykonywanie bieżących napraw" (performing current repairs).
    * **Overseeing and Planning:** "Sprawowanie nadzoru" (Supervising), "planowanie i realizacja budżetu" (planning and implementing the budget), "planowanie i kontrolowanie pracy firmy zewnętrznych" (planning and controlling the work of external companies).
    * **Documentation and Compliance:** "Kontrolowanie i nadzorowanie dokumentacji technicznej" (controlling and supervising technical documentation).

    These responsibilities align well with the tasks described for both **2151: Electrical Engineers** and **3113: Electrical Engineering Technicians**. 

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement requires:
    * **Education:** "Wykształcenie min. średnie kierunkowe - elektryczne" (minimum secondary technical education - electrical).
    * **Experience:** "Doświadczenie w pracy na podobnym stanowisku min. 3 lata" (experience in a similar position min. 3 years).
    * **Practical Knowledge:** "Praktyczna znajomość zagadnień z dziedziny elektryki i podstaw automatyki" (practical knowledge of issues in the field of electricity and basics of automation).
    * **Problem Solving and Teamwork:** "Umiejętność rozwiązywania problemów technicznych i pracy w zespole" (ability to solve technical problems and work in a team).
    * **Certifications:** "Uprawnienia SEP do 6 kV (mile widziane bez ograniczeń)" (SEP qualifications up to 6 kV (preferably without restrictions)).

    The required qualifications suggest a more technical role with hands-on experience, leaning towards **3113: Electrical Engineering Technicians**. However, the requirement for budget planning and overseeing external companies suggests a higher level of responsibility.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**
    * **2151: Electrical Engineers** falls under "Professionals" (Major 2), "Science and Engineering Professionals" (Sub-major 21).
    * **3113: Electrical Engineering Technicians** falls under "Technicians and Associate Professionals" (Major 3), "Science and Engineering Associate Professionals" (Sub-major 31).

    The job advertisement's mix of technical tasks and managerial responsibilities makes it difficult to definitively place it within one of these categories.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3113
**ISCO Title:** Electrical Engineering Technician
**Confidence:** 0.7
**Reasoning:** While the job title suggests a fully-fledged engineer, the emphasis on hands-on maintenance, repairs, and practical knowledge aligns more with an Electrical Engineering Technician's role. The managerial aspects, however, add complexity. It's possible the position involves a blend of responsibilities, demanding both technical expertise and supervisory skills.

## Nanny Job Advertisement Analysis:

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit code:

**1. Translation and Summary:**

The job advertisement, originally in Bulgarian, translates to an English-speaking Nanny position in Sofia, Bulgaria. The family seeks a full-time nanny for their six-month-old son. Key responsibilities include all aspects of the child's care (feeding, hygiene, playtime, development) and communication with the parents in English or Hebrew. 

**2. Analysis based on provided ISCO units:**

* **5311 - Child Care Workers:** This unit best reflects the job description. 
    * **Job Title:** While the ad uses "Nanny," the description aligns with "Child Care Worker."
    * **Tasks:** The ad emphasizes full-time care, including feeding, hygiene, play, and development, directly matching the tasks listed in 5311.
    * **Skills:**  No formal qualifications are explicitly required, aligning with the "medium" skill level of 5311. Language proficiency is specific to this ad, not a universal ISCO requirement.
    * **Environment:** The job is in a private home, a typical setting for 5311.

* **Other ISCO Units:**
    * **1341 (Child Care Service Managers), 2342 (Early Childhood Educators):** These require managing a center or formal teaching, absent in the ad.
    * **3333 (Employment Agents), 5152 (Domestic Housekeepers), 5162 (Companions/Valets), 5164 (Pet Groomers), 5312 (Teacher's Aides), 5322 (Home-based Personal Care Workers), 9111 (Domestic Cleaners):** These are irrelevant to childcare and the ad's core tasks.

**3. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 5311
* **ISCO Title:** Child Care Workers
* **Confidence:** 0.9 
* **Reasoning:** The job's focus on full-time, in-home care for a young child, covering basic needs and development, strongly aligns with the tasks and definition of Child Care Workers.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A 

**Note:** While no perfect match exists (as ISCO is broad), 5311 is the most accurate. The language requirement is job-specific, not an ISCO mismatch.

    - **2424 (Training and Staff Development Professionals):** This unit aligns strongly with the job description. It emphasizes planning, developing, and implementing training programs, which are key responsibilities in the advertisement. The requirement of property management experience further strengthens this match.

    - **3315 (Valuers and Loss Assessors):** This unit focuses on assessing property value and insurance claims, not training. This makes it unsuitable for the job ad.

    - **3333 (Employment Agents and Contractors):** This unit focuses on connecting job seekers with employers, not training individuals for a specific industry. This is not a good match.

    - **3334 (Real Estate Agents and Property Managers):** While this unit relates to the real estate industry, it focuses on sales, rentals, and property management, not training. This makes it a less accurate fit.

    - **3339 (Business Services Agents Not Elsewhere Classified):** This unit is too broad and doesn't align with the specific training focus of the job ad.

    - **3411 (Legal and Related Associate Professionals):** This unit deals with legal support functions and is not relevant to the job ad.

    - **3412 (Social Work Associate Professionals):** This unit focuses on social assistance and community services, making it unsuitable for the job ad.

    - **4131 (Typists and word processing operators):**  This unit emphasizes typing and word processing, skills not highlighted in the job ad. 
    - **3343 (Administrative and executive secretaries):** This unit involves high-level administrative and organizational tasks, exceeding the scope described in the advertisement.
    - **4222 (Contact centre information clerks):** This unit involves providing information and handling transactions over the phone or email. While the job ad mentions "email feedback", it doesn't emphasize customer interaction as a primary responsibility.
    - **4229 (Client information workers not elsewhere classified):** This unit is too broad and doesn't align with the specific data entry focus of the job ad.
    - **4415 (Filing and copying clerks):** This unit involves physical filing and copying, tasks not mentioned in the job ad.
    - **5244 (Contact centre salespersons):** This unit focuses on sales and promoting products, which is not the primary focus of the advertised position.
    - **5322 (Home-based personal care workers):** This unit involves providing personal care and assistance, entirely unrelated to the job ad.

4. **Final assessment:** Based on the emphasis on data entry, computer skills, and online tasks, ISCO unit 4132 (Data entry clerks) appears to be the most appropriate match. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 4132
**ISCO Title:** Data entry clerks

## ISCO Unit Analysis:

**1. ISCO Code 3135: Metal production process controllers**

* **Reasoning:** While the job involves metal work, it focuses on the hands-on welding process, not controlling and monitoring automated production systems. The job ad explicitly mentions "welding of metal parts" and "operation of suction, operation of a pressure station with welding gas," which are not tasks of a process controller. 
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

**2. ISCO Code 7212: Welders and flame cutters**

* **Reasoning:** This unit perfectly aligns with the job title and description. The ad explicitly states "assembling, moving and welding steel and aluminum components," "preparation of the welding table," and "welding of metal parts" which are core tasks of welders. The required "CO2 welding certificate" further confirms this match.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is a strong match.

**3. ISCO Code 7213: Sheet metal workers**

* **Reasoning:** Although the job might involve working with sheet metal at times, the primary focus is on welding, not the fabrication and installation tasks typical of sheet metal workers. The ad doesn't mention shaping, cutting, or installing sheet metal as primary responsibilities.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not the best fit.

**4. ISCO Code 7214: Structural metal preparers and erectors**

* **Reasoning:** This unit focuses on assembling and erecting large-scale metal structures, which doesn't align with the job description. The ad emphasizes component welding, not structural framework erection.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

**5. ISCO Code 7221: Blacksmiths, hammersmiths and forging press workers**

* **Reasoning:** This unit involves shaping metal using forging techniques, which is not mentioned in the job ad. The required skills like "CO2 welding certificate" point towards a different welding process.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

**6. ISCO Code 7222: Toolmakers and related workers**

* **Reasoning:** This unit focuses on creating and repairing specialized tools with high precision, which differs from the advertised welding position. The ad doesn't mention toolmaking or using precision instruments for custom fabrication.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

**7. ISCO Code 7223: Metal working machine tool setters and operators**

* **Reasoning:** This unit involves operating various metalworking machines, which might be used in the welding process. However, the primary focus of the job ad is on the welding itself, not the operation of specific metalworking machines beyond welding equipment. 
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not the primary fit but could be considered as a secondary option.

**8. ISCO Code 8121: Metal processing plant operators**

* **Reasoning:** This unit involves operating machinery for processing and treating metals on a larger scale. The job ad focuses on the individual welding of components, not operating a metal processing plant.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

**9. ISCO Code 8122: Metal finishing, plating and coating machine operators**

* **Reasoning:** This unit involves operating machines for finishing and coating metal surfaces, which is not the primary focus of the advertised position. The ad emphasizes welding, not surface treatment.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

**10. ISCO Code 8142: Plastic products machine operators**

* **Reasoning:** This unit is entirely unrelated to the advertised welding position and deals with plastic processing.
* **Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7212
**ISCO Title:** Welders and flame cutters
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills ("CO2 welding certificate"), and tasks align perfectly with the definition of Welders and flame cutters.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the job advertisement:** The job ad clearly states the need for an "Experienced Counterbalance and Reach Forklift Truck Driver". The main responsibilities involve operating these vehicles within a warehouse environment for loading/unloading, general warehouse duties, and making deliveries.

2. **Comparing with ISCO unit 8344 (Lifting-truck operators):** This unit's description perfectly matches the job ad. The tasks listed like "operating and monitoring lifting truck and similar equipment to load and unload, transport, lift and stack goods" align perfectly with the advertised responsibilities. The required qualifications of "Valid Counterbalance and Reach forklift truck licenses" further solidify this match.

3. **Considering other ISCO units:** While other units like 9333 (Freight handlers) might involve some overlapping tasks like loading/unloading, they lack the specific focus on forklift operation which is central to this job. 

4. **Confidence level:** Given the direct match in job title, description, tasks, and required qualifications, the confidence level for ISCO unit 8344 is very high.

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
**ISCO Title:** Lifting-truck operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on operating counterbalance and reach forklift trucks, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks of ISCO unit 8344.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "7.5t Delivery Driver". This immediately points towards a driving occupation involving a vehicle with a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes.  The description confirms this, highlighting the delivery of heavy furniture.

2. **Evaluate potential ISCO units based on relevance:**
    * **8311 (Locomotive Engine Drivers):** This is immediately irrelevant as the job involves road vehicles, not trains.
    * **8321 (Motorcycle Drivers):**  Also irrelevant. The job requires a Category C1 license, which is for vehicles heavier than motorcycles.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **ISCO 1212 (Human resource managers)**: While the Training Coordinator role falls under the broader umbrella of Human Resources, it doesn't involve the managerial responsibilities outlined in this ISCO unit. The job ad emphasizes training design and delivery, not HR policy development, industrial relations, or budget management. 

2. **ISCO 1213 (Policy and planning managers)**: This unit is not a match. The Training Coordinator role focuses on employee development, not organizational policy or strategic planning.

3. **ISCO 1345 (Education managers)**: This unit is a poor fit. The Training Coordinator role is more hands-on in developing and delivering training, while this unit describes managing educational institutions.

4. **ISCO 2342 (Early childhood educators)**: This unit is completely irrelevant to the job ad, focusing on the education of young children.

5. **ISCO 2351 (Education methods specialists)**: This unit is closer to the job description, as it involves developing teaching methods and materials. However, the Training Coordinator role is less research-focused and more focused on the practical application of training within a corporate setting.

6. **ISCO 2356 (Personnel and careers professionals)**: This unit encompasses a broader range of HR functions. While it mentions training, the core focus is on recruitment, job analysis, and career guidance, not training coordination and delivery.

7. **ISCO 2424 (Training and staff development professionals)**: **This is the most appropriate ISCO unit.** The job description aligns strongly with the tasks outlined in this unit, including identifying training needs, developing materials, delivering training programs, and evaluating their effectiveness.

8. **ISCO 3332 (Conference and event planners)**: While the Training Coordinator may organize training events, this is not the primary focus of the role. This unit is more focused on the logistics and coordination of events in general.

9. **ISCO 4323 (Transport clerks)**: This unit is completely irrelevant to the job ad and can be disregarded.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2424
**ISCO Title:** Training and staff development professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of Training and staff development professionals, focusing on the design, delivery, and evaluation of employee training programs within a corporate setting.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title & Description:** The job title is "Accountant". The description emphasizes compiling financial data, preparing reports, investigating variances, and ensuring compliance with accounting standards. This strongly suggests ISCO 2411 (Accountants) is a good initial match.

2. **Responsibilities & Tasks:** The job ad lists tasks like preparing reports, investigating variances, and working with accounting software. These align perfectly with the tasks described in ISCO 2411. While some tasks like process improvement are mentioned, they are secondary to the core accounting duties.

3. **Skills & Qualifications:** The required qualifications include a degree in accounting or finance and 2-3 years of experience. This further supports the suitability of ISCO 2411, which falls under the "Professionals" major group and requires a similar level of education and experience.

4. **Major/Sub-major Groups:** ISCO 2411 falls under "Professionals" (Major group 2) and "Business and Administration Professionals" (Sub-major 24). This aligns perfectly with the job's nature and required expertise.

5. **Eliminating Alternatives:**  While other ISCO units like 3313 (Accounting Associate Professionals) involve accounting tasks, they represent a lower skill level and typically work under the supervision of accountants. The job ad clearly indicates a higher level of responsibility and autonomy.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2411
**ISCO Title:** Accountants
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, required skills, and experience level all strongly align with the definition and characteristics of ISCO 2411 (Accountants).

**Step 3: Consider required skills and qualifications.**

The advertisement mentions "Pay Rate: Negotiable / Dependent on Experience," indicating a requirement for qualified and potentially experienced veterinarians. This aligns with the high skill level (3-4) associated with ISCO unit **2250**.

**Step 4: Analyze major, sub-major, and minor group relevance.**

ISCO unit **2250: Veterinarians** falls under:
* Major group **2: Professionals**
* Sub-major group **22: Health Professionals**

This categorization is perfectly aligned with the professional and healthcare-related nature of the advertised role.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Job Title and Description:** The job title is "Licensed Security Staff". The description emphasizes security tasks such as crowd management, ensuring safety, responding to incidents, and conducting searches. This immediately points towards security-related ISCO units.

2. **Evaluate ISCO Unit 5414 (Protective Services Workers):** While this unit includes security-related roles, it focuses on tasks like patrolling beaches, controlling traffic, and handling animals. These don't align with the stadium security context.

3. **Evaluate ISCO Unit 5413 (Prison Guards):** This unit is even less relevant. The tasks revolve around managing and supervising inmates within a prison environment, which is vastly different from a stadium setting.

4. **Evaluate ISCO Unit 5412 (Security Guards):** This unit is a strong match. The description explicitly mentions "Security guard" and aligns with the job ad's emphasis on patrolling, controlling access, and maintaining order. The tasks of responding to incidents and enforcing regulations are also direct matches.

5. **Consider Other ISCO Units:**  The remaining units focus on athletes, coaches, licensing officials, and other service workers. None of them align with the core responsibilities outlined in the job advertisement.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5412
**ISCO Title:** Security Guards
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks licensed security personnel for a stadium environment. The described responsibilities of crowd management, ensuring safety, and responding to incidents strongly align with the tasks and definition of Security Guards (ISCO 5412). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO unit 5412 is a very strong match, and no alternative codes are deemed necessary.

Response:
The job advertisement is extremely limited, only providing a job title and stating that it is a full-time position. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine the most appropriate ISCO unit based on the information provided. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Insufficient Information:** The job advertisement lacks details about responsibilities, tasks, required skills, and qualifications. 
2. **Ambiguous Job Title:** The title "DESIGNER" is extremely broad. It could apply to various design fields, including product design, graphic design, web design, interior design, and more. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes:**

Given the lack of information, it is only possible to suggest potential ISCO codes based on the general title "Designer." Here are three possibilities in descending order of relevance, acknowledging that without more information, these are just educated guesses:

1. **ISCO Code (unit): 2163**
   **ISCO Title:** Graphic and multimedia designers
   **Confidence:** 0.2
   **Reasoning:** This is a common design field, and the title "Designer" could imply visual or digital design work. 

2. **ISCO Code (unit): 2163**
   **ISCO Title:** Product and garment designers
   **Confidence:** 0.15
   **Reasoning:** "Designer" could also suggest product design, encompassing a wide range of physical goods.

3. **ISCO Code (unit): 3432**
   **ISCO Title:** Interior designers and decorators
   **Confidence:** 0.1 
   **Reasoning:** While less likely with just the title "Designer," interior design is another possibility.

**To improve the accuracy of the ISCO code prediction, a more detailed job advertisement is needed.**

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Tax Analyst." This title is explicitly listed as a similar job title for ISCO code **2411 (Accountants)**. While "Analyst" appears in other ISCO titles, the specific combination with "Tax" points strongly towards 2411.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job description emphasizes tasks like preparing tax filings, income tax provisions, and tax research. These align directly with the tasks described for ISCO code **2411 (Accountants)**, particularly points (b) and (c). 

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The required qualifications include a Bachelor's in Accounting, preference for a Master's in Taxation and CPA, and experience in accounting and tax. These qualifications strongly suggest a professional role focused on accounting and tax, aligning with the skill level and requirements of **2411 (Accountants)**.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO code **2411 (Accountants)** falls under Major group 2 (Professionals), Sub-major group 24 (Business and Administration Professionals). This categorization accurately reflects the professional nature of the job and its focus on business and administration through tax accounting.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2411
**ISCO Title:** Accountants
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, responsibilities, required qualifications, and overall focus of the advertisement strongly align with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO code 2411 (Accountants). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

**Explanation for not providing alternatives:** The provided ISCO code 2411 (Accountants) is a very strong match for the job advertisement. There is no compelling reason to consider alternative codes as the alignment is clear and consistent across all analyzed factors.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the job advertisement:** The job title is "Care Assistant," and the description emphasizes providing personal care, companionship, and support to individuals in their homes and communities. The role requires no prior experience, suggesting a lower skill level than some other healthcare professions.

2. **Comparing with ISCO units:**

    * **ISCO 3221 (Nursing associate professionals):** While involving personal care, this unit requires providing basic nursing and working under the supervision of health professionals. The ad doesn't mention medical tasks beyond basic health monitoring, and explicitly states no experience is needed, making this unit less likely.

    * **ISCO 3253 (Community health workers):** This unit focuses on health education, referrals, and community outreach. The ad emphasizes personal care and individual support, not community-level health work, making this unit less relevant.

    * **ISCO 3333 (Employment agents and contractors):** This unit is entirely unrelated, focusing on connecting job seekers with employers.

    * **ISCO 3412 (Social work associate professionals):** This unit involves social assistance programs and helping clients navigate social services. While some aspects like accompanying individuals to appointments are relevant, the core focus on personal care makes this unit a less perfect fit.

    * **ISCO 5162 (Companions and valets):** This unit aligns well with the companionship aspect but doesn't encompass the personal care duties described.

    * **ISCO 5311 (Child care workers):** This unit is specifically for children and thus not applicable.

    * **ISCO 5321 (Health care assistants):** This unit focuses on personal care within healthcare settings like hospitals, under direct supervision. The ad emphasizes home-based care, making this unit less suitable.

    * **ISCO 5322 (Home-based personal care workers):** This unit strongly aligns with the ad. It involves providing personal care, assistance with daily living, and emotional support in private homes, matching the description closely.

    * **ISCO 5329 (Other personal care workers):** This unit is too broad and covers roles not directly related to the ad, like dental aides.

3. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, ISCO 5322 (Home-based personal care workers) is the most appropriate unit. The job description aligns strongly with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for this unit.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5322
**ISCO Title:** Home-based personal care workers
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement emphasizes providing personal care, assistance with daily living, and emotional support in individuals' homes, which aligns perfectly with the definition of Home-based personal care workers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3412, 5162, 5321

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Facilities Manager". This title is explicitly mentioned as an example within the descriptions of ISCO unit 1219: Business Services and Administration Managers not elsewhere classified. 

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job advertisement lists the following responsibilities:
    * Managing a team, including one-on-ones, discipline, and grievances.
    * Client relationship management.
    * Adaptability to changing site needs.
    * Responsibility for HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment).
    * Reporting.

    * Overseeing cleaning and security.

    These responsibilities align strongly with the tasks outlined in ISCO unit 1219, particularly:
    * (f) leading, managing and developing administrative staff
    * (g) representing the enterprise...in negotiations
    * (j) overseeing the selection, training and performance of staff
    * (i) planning and directing daily operations

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The job advertisement emphasizes:
    * Self-motivation.
    * Immediate availability.
    * Managerial or strong supervisory experience, ideally in security, events, soft services, or healthcare.
    * Flexibility.
    * Strong communication skills.

    These requirements match the "Managers, professionals, and technicians" skill group and "Skill levels 3 and 4 (high)" skill level associated with ISCO unit 1219.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO unit 1219 falls under:
    * Major group 1: Managers 
    * Sub-major group 12: Administrative and Commercial Managers
    * Minor group 121: Business Services and Administration Managers

    The job advertisement's focus on managing facilities, staff, and client relationships within a likely corporate or organizational setting aligns perfectly with these classifications.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1219
**ISCO Title:** Business Services and Administration Managers not elsewhere classified
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, responsibilities, required skills, and industry context all strongly indicate that ISCO unit 1219 is a perfect match for this Facilities Manager position.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "CNC Machine Operator," specifically focusing on a "CNC Press Brake Operator." This points towards a role involving machine operation rather than process control or hand forging.

2. **Examine main responsibilities and tasks:** The core duties involve operating a CNC Press Brake, ensuring accurate component production, working with engineering drawings, and adhering to safety protocols. These tasks align strongly with machine operation within metal working.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad emphasizes CNC Press Brake experience, working with technical drawings, and familiarity with Amada Press Brakes (a specific brand). This reinforces the need for specialized machine operation skills.

4. **Evaluate ISCO units based on the above analysis:**

    * **7223 - Metal working machine tool setters and operators:** This unit aligns perfectly. It includes operating CNC machines, working with tolerances, and producing metal articles. The required skills and tasks in the ad directly match this unit's description.

    * **Other ISCO units:**  The remaining units are less relevant. 3135 focuses on process control, not direct machine operation. 7221 involves hand forging, which is not mentioned. The rest relate to woodworking, mineral products, metal processing beyond machine operation, finishing/coating, plastics, paper, and food production – none of which are relevant to this CNC operator role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7223
**ISCO Title:** Metal working machine tool setters and operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a CNC machine operator role within metal working. The tasks, skills, and required experience align perfectly with the definition of ISCO unit 7223.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternatives are needed as 7223 is a very strong match.

Job Ad ID: 825515780, Row: 25593, Pred: 3221, 2221, 3412, 1343, 1342, 5321, 5329, 3253, 3413, 5322
Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2221
**ISCO Title:** Nursing Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** This job advertisement heavily emphasizes nursing care responsibilities and expertise. The title explicitly mentions "Registered Mental Health Nurse/Registered Nurse Learning Disabilities" (RMN/RNLD), aligning with the "Nursing Professionals" ISCO unit. The description further reinforces this by highlighting tasks like individualizing care, understanding patient needs, leading shifts, and applying nursing knowledge. The required qualifications (RMN/RNLD) are specific to professional nursing roles.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3221, 3253, 5321

## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the Job Title and Description:** The title "Staff / Senior Staff Nurse RMN/RNLD" immediately points towards a nursing profession. The description confirms this by focusing on patient care, treatment plans, and collaboration with other healthcare professionals.

2. **Matching with Provided ISCO Units:**
    * **2221 - Nursing Professionals:** This unit perfectly encapsulates the job's core responsibilities. The description's emphasis on individualized care, treatment planning, and collaboration aligns with the tasks listed for Nursing Professionals. The required RMN/RNLD qualifications solidify this match.
    * **Other ISCO Units:**  While other units like "Aged care services managers" (1343) or "Nursing associate professionals" (3221) might seem relevant at first glance, they don't fully encompass the required expertise and autonomy. The job clearly demands a professional nursing qualification and focuses on direct patient care, exceeding the scope of associate roles or managerial positions.

3. **Considering Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement explicitly requires RMN/RNLD qualifications, signifying professional nursing credentials. This aligns with the high skill level (3 & 4) associated with ISCO unit 2221.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO 2221 falls under:
    * **Major Group 2:** Professionals - This accurately reflects the job's requirement for specialized knowledge and skills.
    * **Sub-major Group 22:** Health Professionals -  The job explicitly operates within the healthcare sector.

**Conclusion:** Based on the job title, detailed description, required qualifications, and alignment with ISCO categories, the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement is **2221 - Nursing Professionals** with high confidence.

Job Ad ID: 752391158, Row: 25592, Pred: 8344, 9333, 8332, 4321, 8343, 8341, 9334, 9329, 4323, 8321
Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**

The job title is "Counterbalance FLT Driver," which clearly indicates the primary responsibility of operating a counterbalance forklift truck. This aligns strongly with the ISCO unit **8344 - Lifting truck operators**, whose description includes "Forklift truck driver" as a direct example.

**Step 2: Evaluate main responsibilities and tasks.**

The job advertisement lists the following tasks:

*   Collecting & packing orders
*   Loading & unloading transport
*   General warehouse responsibilities
*   Forklift truck driver operator
*   Compliance with instructions and procedures
*   Production work when not operating FLT

These tasks heavily emphasize the use of a forklift for material handling within a warehouse environment. This aligns perfectly with the tasks described for ISCO unit **8344 - Lifting truck operators**. 

**Step 3: Assess required skills and qualifications.**

The job ad requires:

*   Counterbalance Forklift Truck Certificate (essential)
*   Reliability, punctuality, and a "can-do" attitude
*   Good timekeeping

These requirements emphasize the technical skill of operating a forklift, along with basic workplace competencies.  The skill level for **8344 - Lifting truck operators** is "Skill level 2 (medium)," which seems appropriate given the required certification and responsibilities.

**Step 4: Consider the ISCO major, sub-major, and minor groups.**

ISCO unit **8344** falls under:

*   Major group **8**: Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
*   Sub-major group **83**: Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators

This categorization accurately reflects the nature of the job, which involves operating a mobile plant (forklift) within a warehouse setting.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
**ISCO Title:** Lifting truck operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:**  The job title, description, tasks, required skills, and ISCO categorization all point definitively to  "Lifting truck operators" as the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as the primary prediction has a high confidence level.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Home Care Worker" and the description emphasizing providing care and assistance to vulnerable individuals in their homes closely align with the definition and tasks of **ISCO 5322: Home-based Personal Care Workers**. 

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists tasks like personal care, medication administration, meal preparation, companionship, and light housekeeping. These tasks are explicitly mentioned within the description of ISCO 5322.

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** While the ad mentions a "care certificate" and driver's license as preferred, it doesn't specify professional medical training. This aligns with ISCO 5322, which focuses on routine care and assistance, often following care plans established by healthcare professionals.

4. **Evaluate the ISCO code structure:** ISCO 5322 falls under:
    - **Major group 5: Services and Sales Workers:** This aligns with the service-oriented nature of the job.
    - **Sub-major group 53: Personal Care Workers:** This accurately reflects the core responsibility of providing personal care.

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:**
    - **ISCO 3221 (Nursing associate professionals)** requires more specialized medical knowledge and often involves working under direct supervision in healthcare settings, which doesn't match the job ad.
    - **ISCO 3253 (Community health workers)** focus on health education, referrals, and community outreach, differing from the direct personal care emphasized in the ad. 
    - The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant, focusing on social work, client information, housekeeping, childcare, or in-hospital assistance.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5322
**ISCO Title:** Home-based Personal Care Workers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, required qualifications, and overall focus strongly indicate this position aligns with the definition and scope of Home-based Personal Care Workers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO 5322 is a strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Steel Erector". The description emphasizes working with "structural beams and columns" and "erecting steel buildings". This points towards skilled trades related to metal structures.

2. **Evaluate ISCO 7111 (House builders):** This unit focuses on houses and small buildings, not large-scale steel structures. The materials and tasks don't align with the job ad. Thus, it's not a match.

3. **Evaluate ISCO 7115 (Carpenters and joiners):** While involving construction, this unit centers on wood and similar materials. The job ad explicitly mentions steel, making this unit unsuitable.

4. **Evaluate ISCO 7119 (Building frame and related trades workers):** This unit includes diverse roles, but the examples (steeplejacks, scaffolders) don't match the core tasks of a steel erector. While scaffolding might be used, it's not the primary focus. This unit is too broad.

5. **Evaluate ISCO 7121 (Roofers):**  This unit focuses on roof construction and repair. While steel buildings have roofs, the job ad emphasizes structural work, not roofing specifically. This unit is too narrow.

6. **Evaluate ISCO 7212 (Welders and flame cutters):**  Welding is mentioned as a desired skill, but not the primary focus. Steel erectors assemble pre-fabricated components, welding is supplementary. This unit is too focused on a single skill.

7. **Evaluate ISCO 7213 (Sheet metal workers):** This unit deals with shaping and installing sheet metal, which is different from erecting large steel structures. The scale and type of work don't align. This unit is not a match.

8. **Evaluate ISCO 7214 (Structural metal preparers and erectors):** This unit directly matches the job title and description. Tasks like erecting steel frameworks, assembling metal parts, and potentially riveting align perfectly. This is a strong match.

9. **Evaluate ISCO 7215 (Riggers and cable splicers):** While rigging might be involved in moving heavy steel components, it's not the core function of a steel erector. This unit is relevant but not the primary focus.

10. **Evaluate ISCO 9312 (Civil engineering labourers):** This unit involves basic tasks under supervision. The job ad implies a skilled role with specific experience, making this unit unsuitable.

11. **Evaluate ISCO 9313 (Building construction labourers):** Similar to 9312, this unit focuses on unskilled labor. The job ad requires specialized knowledge and experience, making this unit a poor match.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7214
**ISCO Title:** Structural metal preparers and erectors
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** The job title and description strongly align with the tasks and skills associated with ISCO 7214. Erecting steel frameworks, working with structural beams and columns, and potentially riveting are core duties of this unit.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 7215, 7212, 7119

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Match:** The job title is "Landscape Architect". This directly matches the "Example of the occupations classified here" for ISCO code **2162: Landscape Architects**. 

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job description emphasizes:
    *  "Preparation of design guidance and landscape strategy work" - Aligns with **2162**'s task (d) - preparing plans and drawings.
    * "Landscape and visual impact assessment" - Aligns with **2162**'s task (c) - analyzing site and community data for land use recommendations and environmental impact statements.
    * "Proven design ability, effective contract and project management skills" - Aligns with **2162**'s tasks (e) and (h) - writing specifications, managing contracts, and monitoring construction.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:**
    * "Landscape Architecture degree" - Directly supports **2162**.
    * "Strong negotiating, interpersonal and presentation skills" -  Essential for **2162**'s tasks involving client consultation, stakeholder management, and presenting plans.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**
    * **2162** falls under Major Group **2 - Professionals**, Sub-major Group **21 - Science and Engineering Professionals**, which perfectly aligns with the requirements of a Landscape Architect.

## Conclusion:

Based on the strong alignment of the job title, description, required skills, and ISCO category, the most appropriate ISCO unit is:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2162
**ISCO Title:** Landscape Architects
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks a Landscape Architect, and the responsibilities, required qualifications, and tasks described perfectly match the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 2162. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as the match to 2162 is highly confident.

Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**

The job title is "Sales & Business Development Manager" or "Regional Sales Executive / Business Development Manager." This suggests a role focused on sales and expanding the business in a specific region (Midlands). 

**Step 2: Review main responsibilities and tasks.**

While the advertisement doesn't explicitly list responsibilities, the focus on "Sales" and "Business Development" implies tasks like:

* Identifying and pursuing new business opportunities within the drainage and wastewater industry.
* Managing existing client relationships and generating new sales.
* Negotiating and closing deals.
* Potentially managing a sales team or working independently.

**Step 3: Consider required skills and qualifications.**

The advertisement mentions a required salary range, indicating experience is likely necessary.  We can infer skills like:

* Strong communication and negotiation skills.
* Knowledge of the drainage/wastewater industry.
* Sales experience, potentially in a technical field.

**Step 4: Analyze ISCO units in descending order of relevance.**

1. **ISCO 1221: Sales and Marketing Managers:** This unit aligns strongly with the job title and implied tasks. The description emphasizes planning, directing sales activities, managing budgets, and overseeing staff. This is a strong potential match.

2. **ISCO 2433: Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT):** While the industry (drainage/wastewater) has a technical aspect, this unit focuses on representing companies selling specific goods and services. The emphasis on technical knowledge and client consultation makes it less fitting than 1221.

3. **ISCO 2434: Information and communications technology (ICT) sales professionals:** This unit is irrelevant as the job is not related to ICT.

4. **ISCO 3322: Commercial sales representatives:** This unit focuses on representing companies to sell goods and services, providing product information. While there's overlap with sales, the "Manager" title suggests a higher level of responsibility than typically associated with sales representatives.

5. **Other ISCO units:** The remaining units focus on managing directors, administrative services, research and development, manufacturing, and construction. None of these align with the job advertisement.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1221
**ISCO Title:** Sales and Marketing Managers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, focus on sales and business development, and implied tasks strongly suggest a managerial role within sales, aligning with the definition of Sales and Marketing Managers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2433, 3322, 1219

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "Trainee Bartender" strongly suggests the primary function is to learn and perform the tasks of a bartender. 

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The description emphasizes learning ("Trainee", "willing to learn"), customer service ("Excellent communication skills"), and working in a fast-paced environment ("busy and vibrant"). These align well with the typical duties of a bartender.

3. **ISCO Unit Comparison:**
    * **5132: Bartenders:** This unit perfectly matches the job title and aligns with the description's emphasis on learning the role. The tasks listed under this unit (preparing and serving drinks, managing the bar area, etc.) are precisely what a trainee bartender would be expected to learn.
    * **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining units are not relevant. They involve managing restaurants (1412), providing accommodation services (4224), attending to passengers (5111), serving food (5131),  entertaining (5169), preparing food (5246, 9412), tasting and grading (7515), or cleaning (9112). None of these align with the core responsibilities outlined in the job advertisement.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5132
**ISCO Title:** Bartenders
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title explicitly mentions "Bartender" and the description focuses on learning the role, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO unit 5132.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO unit 5132 is a perfect match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Job Ad ID: 861294328, Row: 25586, Pred: 1120, 1221, 2431, 1222, 1219, 1223, 1330, 1321, 1420, 1439
Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**
The job title is "Managing Director - B2B Digital Marketing agency." This indicates a top-level management role within a specific industry (digital marketing). The description emphasizes responsibilities like overseeing client services, driving revenue, managing financials, and leading the team. This aligns strongly with the responsibilities of ISCO unit **1120: Managing Directors and Chief Executives**.

**Step 2: Evaluate main responsibilities and tasks.**
The job ad lists tasks such as:
* Overseeing strategic direction of client accounts
* Driving agency revenue and growth
* Developing business development strategies
* Managing P&L and financials
* Managing and developing the team
* Leading recruitment
* Creating a positive and collaborative work environment

These tasks align with the description of ISCO unit 1120, which includes planning, directing, coordinating, evaluating, managing budgets, and leading the organization.

**Step 3: Consider required skills and qualifications.**
The job ad requires:
* Previous agency experience
* Solid P&L experience
* Impeccable strategic business planning skills
* Exceptional track record of driving client growth
* Commercial management experience
* Effective team management capabilities
* Strong business and financial acumen

These skills and qualifications are typical for top-level management positions and match the high skill level (3) associated with ISCO unit 1120.

**Step 4: Analyze major, sub-major, and minor groups.**
ISCO unit 1120 falls under:
* Major group 1: Managers
* Sub-major group 11: Chief Executives, Senior Officials and Legislators

This categorization accurately reflects the job's nature as a top-level management position with significant decision-making authority.

**Step 5: Compare with other potential ISCO units.**
While other ISCO units like **1219: Business Services and Administration Managers** or **1221: Sales and Marketing Managers** involve some overlapping responsibilities, they don't encompass the full scope and seniority of this role. The Managing Director position has a broader impact on the entire agency, including financial performance, strategic direction, and team leadership, exceeding the scope of these alternative units.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1120
**ISCO Title:** Managing Directors and Chief Executives
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, responsibilities, required skills, and level of autonomy all strongly indicate that this role aligns perfectly with the definition of Managing Directors and Chief Executives. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as the match to 1120 is highly confident.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Senior Vehicle Technician," and the description emphasizes performing maintenance and repairs on a wide range of vehicles. This immediately points towards ISCO unit **7231: Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers**. The provided related job titles like "Automotive brakes systems service technician" and "Motor vehicle mechanic" further strengthen this initial assessment.

2. **Evaluate main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists tasks such as performing scheduled maintenance, technical repairs, and working on various vehicles. These tasks align perfectly with the description of ISCO unit 7231. 

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** Although the ad doesn't explicitly list qualifications, it implies a need for experience ("Senior" technician, "qualified and experienced" individuals). This aligns with the "Skill level 2 (medium)" assigned to ISCO unit 7231.

4. **Assess major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO unit 7231 falls under:
    - Major group 7: Craft and Related Trades Workers
    - Sub-major group 72: Metal, Machinery and Related Trades Workers 
    This categorization accurately reflects the hands-on, technical nature of the advertised role.

**Final prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7231
**ISCO Title:** Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, and implied skill level all strongly indicate that this position best fits the ISCO unit 7231: Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO unit perfectly matches the job advertisement, so no alternative codes are necessary.

Job Ad ID: 770738396, Row: 25584, Pred: 7532, 2163, 7531, 7318, 5241, 7535, 7533, 7536, 8159, 3432
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2163 - Product and garment designers:** This unit has the highest relevance as the job title "Fashion Designer" is explicitly listed as an example occupation. 
2. **Analyzing the description:** The job ad mentions responsibilities like making garments, following specs, and creating patterns for production. These tasks align with the description of ISCO 2163, particularly points (b), (d), (g), and (h).
3. **Skills and qualifications:** While the ad doesn't detail specific skills, the requirement of 2 years of experience suggests a level of expertise aligning with skill level 3 ("high") mentioned in ISCO 2163.
4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The categorization under "Professionals", specifically "Science and Engineering Professionals" further supports the suitability of ISCO 2163 for this job.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2163
**ISCO Title:** Product and garment designers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required experience, and industry focus strongly indicate that this position aligns with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for Product and garment designers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO code is a strong match.

Job Ad ID: 758384183, Row: 25583, Pred: 1211, 2411, 3313, 3352, 2433, 1219, 1343, 4311, 1342, 1112
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Senior Manager (m/f/d) Accounting & Order to Cash". This suggests a managerial role focused on accounting and finance, specifically the order-to-cash cycle. This aligns with the responsibilities outlined in the description.

2. **Review potential ISCO units in descending relevance:**

    * **1112 - Senior government officials:** This is immediately irrelevant. The job ad is for a private company, not a government position. 
    * **1211 - Finance managers:** This is a strong potential match. The title aligns, and the description of planning, directing, and coordinating financial operations, budgeting, and overseeing financial operations all fit the job ad's responsibilities.
    * **1219 - Business services and administration managers not elsewhere classified:** While this mentions administrative and financial tasks, it's too broad. The job ad is clearly focused on accounting, not general business services.
    * **1342 - Health services managers:**  Irrelevant. The company is pharmaceutical, but this role is financial, not healthcare-related.
    * **1343 - Aged care services managers:**  Irrelevant, same reasoning as above.
    * **2411 - Accountants:** This focuses on the *tasks* of accounting (auditing, tax returns, etc.). While the Senior Manager would oversee these, it's likely they're not doing them personally at this level.
    * **2433 - Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT):**  Irrelevant, this is a sales role, not finance.
    * **3313 - Accounting associate professionals:** This is too junior. The ad emphasizes managing teams, closing processes, and high-level interaction, not the hands-on work of an assistant.
    * **3352 - Government tax and excise officials:** Irrelevant, private sector role.
    * **4311 - Accounting and bookkeeping clerks:** Far too junior, this is a clerical position.

3. **Focus on the best fit (1211 - Finance managers):**

    * **Responsibilities match:** Budgeting, financial reporting, internal controls, managing relationships with internal and external stakeholders are all core duties of a Finance Manager.
    * **Skills and qualifications align:**  The ad requires a finance/accounting degree, 8+ years of experience (indicating seniority), strong knowledge of GAAP and tax legislation, and experience with financial software (SAP). These are all expected for a Finance Manager.
    * **Level of expertise and autonomy:** The role involves managing a team, acting as a key partner to other departments, and handling complex accounting and tax matters. This signifies a high level of autonomy and decision-making expected of a Finance Manager.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1211
**ISCO Title:** Finance managers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, responsibilities, required skills, and level of seniority strongly align with the ISCO description of a Finance Manager. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  While 1211 is a very strong fit, if a more granular code is needed, alternatives could be:

* **2411 - Accountants (with lower confidence):**  If the role involves more direct accounting work than management, this could be considered, but it's less likely given the seniority.
* **1219 - Business services and administration managers not elsewhere classified (with very low confidence):** Only if the finance focus was far less specific than it appears.
* No other provided code is remotely suitable.

Job Ad ID: 854366848, Row: 25582, Pred: 5243, 9510, 5242, 5152, 9111, 4214, 9112, 9612, 9622, 9621
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Door to Door Fundraiser". This title is very similar to the "Door-to-door salesperson" listed in the ISCO unit **5243: Door-to-door salespersons**. 

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad emphasizes tasks like:
    - Delivering information about the charity.
    -  Representing the charity and soliciting support.
    -  Working within a team to achieve fundraising goals.

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** The ad highlights:
    -  Being friendly, talkative, and motivated.
    -  No prior experience is necessary, suggesting on-the-job training.

4. **Compare with ISCO 5243:**
    -  While the job involves approaching people door-to-door, the focus is on raising funds for charity, not directly selling goods or services as described in 5243. 
    -  The tasks in the ad align more with informing and persuading the public, rather than closing sales transactions.
    -  The lack of required experience doesn't fit the typical profile of a salesperson.

5. **Consider alternative ISCO units:** Since 5243 isn't a perfect match, let's explore alternatives:
    -  **4214: Debt collectors and related workers:** This unit includes "Charity collector". While the job involves collecting funds, it's about securing new donations, not collecting on existing debts.
    -  **9510: Street and related services workers:**  This unit involves providing various services on the street. While door-to-door fundraising shares similarities with street work, it's more structured and focused on a specific cause.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):**  None of the provided units are a perfect fit.

**Reasoning:**  The job of a Door to Door Fundraiser, while sharing elements with sales and street services, primarily focuses on representing a charity, raising awareness, and soliciting donations. This doesn't align perfectly with the provided ISCO unit descriptions.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**

1. **9621: Messengers, package deliverers and luggage porters:** This unit emphasizes delivering messages and items, which aligns with the communication aspect of the fundraiser role. However, it lacks the fundraising and public engagement element. 
2. **5242: Sales demonstrators:** This unit focuses on demonstrating and promoting products to stimulate buying interest. While not directly selling, fundraisers similarly aim to persuade the public to support a cause.
3. **9111: Domestic cleaners and helpers:** This unit is a stretch, but it highlights tasks like purchasing supplies and interacting with households, which are loosely connected to a fundraiser's responsibilities.

offer Submitted By: District Labour Office in Rzeszów
Application language: Polish

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Job Title and Description:** The job title explicitly mentions "BRICKLAYER" and the description emphasizes "MASONRY WORKS." This strongly suggests tasks related to laying bricks and building structures, aligning with the ISCO unit **7112: Bricklayers and related workers.**

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The advertisement specifies "MASONRY WORKS - FOR NEWLY BUILT BUILDINGS," indicating construction tasks involving bricks or similar materials. This further supports the relevance of ISCO unit **7112**.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** While the advertisement doesn't list specific skills, it does mention "ability to read technical drawings - welcome." This skill is essential for bricklayers to interpret construction plans, reinforcing the suitability of ISCO unit **7112**.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO unit **7112** falls under:
    - Major group 7: Craft and Related Trades Workers
    - Sub-major group 71: Building and Related Trades Workers (excluding Electricians) 
    - Minor group 711: Building Frame and Related Trades Workers

    These classifications perfectly match the nature of the advertised job, which involves skilled craft work in building construction.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7112
**ISCO Title:** Bricklayers and related workers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required tasks, and desired skills strongly indicate a bricklaying role, directly aligning with the definition and tasks outlined in ISCO unit 7112.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

**Explanation for not providing alternatives:** The provided ISCO unit 7112 is a very strong match for the job advertisement. There is no compelling reason to consider alternative codes as the information provided clearly points to a bricklaying role.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2412 (Financial and investment advisers):** While this unit mentions insurance as part of a financial plan, the job ad focuses solely on selling insurance, not comprehensive financial planning. This unit is too broad and doesn't match the core duties.

2. **ISCO 2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals):** This unit is not relevant. It focuses on selling industrial, medical, and pharmaceutical goods and services, which doesn't align with the Life Insurance Agent role.

3. **ISCO 3321 (Insurance representatives):** This is a strong match. The description directly mentions advising on and selling various insurance types, aligning perfectly with the job ad's responsibilities of selling, soliciting, and explaining insurance plans. The required skills like familiarity with insurance plans and client relationship management further confirm this match.

4. **ISCO 3322 (Commercial sales representatives):** While this unit involves selling, it focuses on general goods and services to businesses. The Life Insurance Agent role is more specialized in insurance products for individuals and potentially businesses, making this a less accurate fit than 3321.

5. **ISCO 3333 (Employment agents and contractors):** This unit is completely irrelevant, focusing on connecting job seekers with employers, not selling insurance.

6. **ISCO 3334 (Real estate agents and property managers):** This unit is also irrelevant, dealing with real estate transactions, not insurance.

7. **ISCO 3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified):** While this is a broad category, the specific examples provided (advertising, auctioneering, etc.) don't align with the Life Insurance Agent role. 

8. **ISCO 4312 (Statistical, finance and insurance clerks):** This unit focuses on clerical tasks within insurance companies, not the direct sales and client interaction described in the job ad. 

9. **ISCO 5243 (Door-to-door salespersons):** Although the job ad mentions generating new business and referrals, it doesn't specify door-to-door sales. This unit is too narrow and might not reflect the full scope of the agent's work.

10. **ISCO 5244 (Contact centre salespersons):** Similar to 5243, this unit is too specific. The ad doesn't limit the agent to phone or electronic communication sales. 


## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit): 3321**
**ISCO Title: Insurance representatives**
**Confidence: 0.9**
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement's title, description, responsibilities, and required skills strongly align with the definition and tasks of an Insurance representative (ISCO 3321). This unit accurately reflects the core function of advising on and selling insurance plans to clients.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 3322, 5243, 5244** 

While 3321 is the most accurate, these alternatives could be considered with lower confidence if the role involves a stronger emphasis on general business sales (3322) or relies heavily on specific sales approaches like door-to-door (5243) or contact center methods (5244).

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Analyze the Job Title and Description:** The title "Talent Acquisition Advisor" suggests a role focused on recruitment and attracting talent. This aligns with descriptions found in ISCO units related to Human Resources and Employment services. 

2. **Examine Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad emphasizes:
    - Managing the end-to-end recruitment process.
    - Sourcing, screening, and interviewing candidates.
    - Building talent pipelines.
    - Supporting and coaching hiring managers.
    -  Using LinkedIn Recruiter and Applicant Tracking Systems.
    These tasks closely match the responsibilities described for **ISCO 2423: Personnel and careers professionals**.

3. **Evaluate Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires:
    - Experience in recruitment, sourcing, and screening.
    - Experience managing multiple deadlines and a fast-paced environment.
    - Strong communication and collaboration skills.
    These skills align with the expertise expected of **personnel and careers professionals**.

4. **Consider Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**
    - **ISCO 2423** falls under:
        - Major Group 2: Professionals
        - Sub-major Group 24: Business and Administration Professionals
    - This categorization accurately reflects the professional nature of the role and its focus on business and administration functions within HR.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2423
**ISCO Title:** Personnel and careers professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** This job advertisement strongly aligns with the tasks, skills, and required expertise of Personnel and careers professionals. The focus on end-to-end recruitment, building talent pipelines, and advising hiring managers falls squarely within this ISCO unit's scope.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 1219 (Business Services and Administration Managers):** While the Nursery Room Manager has administrative tasks like managing staff and resources, the core focus is on childcare, not general business administration. This unit is too broad and doesn't reflect the specialized knowledge needed for early childhood development.

2. **ISCO 1341 (Child Care Services Managers):** This is a strong match. The job title ("Nursery Room Manager/Room Supervisor") aligns with similar titles listed ("Manager, nursery: childcare"). The description emphasizes planning activities, ensuring child safety and well-being, communicating with parents, and adhering to educational standards, all core tasks of this unit.

3. **ISCO 1343 (Aged Care Services Managers):** This is not a match. The job explicitly focuses on children under 5, while this unit deals with the elderly. The required qualifications and experience wouldn't be applicable.

4. **ISCO 1345 (Education Managers):** This unit is a potential match, but less specific than 1341. While the Nursery Room Manager oversees learning activities, their role is more hands-on and less focused on the broader educational administration that this unit emphasizes (e.g., setting school-wide policies, managing budgets across departments).

5. **ISCO 1411 (Hotel Managers):** This is not a match. The focus is on guest accommodation and services, not childcare. The required skills and experience are entirely different.

6. **ISCO 2342 (Early Childhood Educators):** This unit focuses on the direct teaching and caregiving aspects, while the job ad emphasizes managerial duties *in addition* to being a keyworker.  A Room Manager likely supervises other educators, making this unit too narrow.

7. **ISCO 5151 (Cleaning and Housekeeping Supervisors):** This is not a match. While maintaining a clean and safe environment is important, it's a small part of the Nursery Room Manager's responsibilities. The focus here is on cleaning tasks, not childcare.

8. **ISCO 5152 (Domestic Housekeepers):** Similar to 5151, this is too narrow and focuses on household tasks rather than the specialized care and education of young children.

9. **ISCO 5311 (Child Care Workers):** This unit is too narrow, focusing solely on the caregiving aspect without the managerial responsibilities outlined in the job ad.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1341
**ISCO Title:** Child Care Services Managers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** This unit strongly aligns with the job title, required qualifications, and described responsibilities, particularly the focus on managing staff, ensuring child well-being, and implementing early childhood education programs.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1345, 2342, 5311

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Commercial Property Solicitor".  This immediately points towards a legal profession and aligns strongly with the ISCO unit **2611: Lawyers**. 

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The job description emphasizes:
    * **Legal Advice:** Advising clients on property matters within the social housing market.
    * **Legal Documentation:**  Handling land acquisitions, development agreements, title reports, freehold/leasehold transactions, and property security transactions.
    * **Client Representation:**  Though not explicitly stated, a solicitor often represents clients' interests.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires experience in housing-related property work,  demonstrating specialized legal knowledge.

4. **ISCO Unit Alignment:**
    * **2611: Lawyers** perfectly encapsulates the core responsibilities, required expertise, and typical tasks of a Commercial Property Solicitor. 
    * Other ISCO units are not relevant:
        * **2423: Personnel and careers professionals** deals with HR activities, not legal matters.
        * **2619: Legal professionals not elsewhere classified**  is too broad and doesn't fit the specialized nature of property law.
        * The remaining ISCO units focus on sales, administrative support, building management, or construction, none of which align with the solicitor role. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
**ISCO Title:** Lawyers
**Confidence:** 1.0 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks a solicitor specializing in commercial property law. The tasks, required experience, and job title all align perfectly with the definition and typical duties of a lawyer specializing in this field.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are necessary as 2611 is a very strong match.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Vehicle Mechanic," and the description emphasizes vehicle maintenance, repair, diagnostics, and working with mechanical and electrical systems. This immediately points towards ISCO unit **7231: Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers**.

2. **Compare responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists tasks like diagnosing faults, repairing/replacing parts, working on electrical and mechanical systems, and using diagnostic equipment. These align perfectly with the tasks described for ISCO unit 7231.

3. **Evaluate required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires technical knowledge, experience with diagnostic equipment, quality standards adherence, and potentially MOT Tester certification. These are all skills and qualifications expected of Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers.

4. **Consider major/sub-major groups:** ISCO unit 7231 falls under major group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers) and sub-major group 72 (Metal, Machinery and Related Trades Workers). This accurately reflects the hands-on, technical nature of the advertised role.

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:** While some tasks might relate to other units (e.g., electrical aspects linking to 7412: Electrical mechanics and fitters), none encompass the full scope of the job advertisement as comprehensively as 7231.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7231
**ISCO Title:** Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a Vehicle Mechanic role, aligning perfectly with the tasks, skills, and qualifications outlined for ISCO unit 7231.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO unit 7231 is a precise match, eliminating the need for alternatives.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2151 (Electrical engineer):** While the job involves electrical principles, the focus on IC design, particularly analog circuits within digital devices (FPGAs), points to a specialization beyond general electrical engineering. 
2. **ISCO 2152 (Electronics engineer):** This is a strong contender. The job description aligns well with designing electronic components (ADCs, DACs), understanding circuit behavior, and using simulation tools. The required Master's degree and 5+ years of experience also fit the "Skill levels 3 and 4 (high)" description.
3. **ISCO 2153 (Telecommunications engineer):**  The job ad mentions applications in wireless communication, but the core focus is on designing the analog components within FPGAs, not the communication systems themselves. This makes it less relevant than 2152.
4. **ISCO 2163 (Product and garment designers):**  This is not relevant. The job is about designing electronic circuits, not physical products or garments.
5. **ISCO 2166 (Graphic and multimedia designers):**  Also not relevant. The job deals with hardware and circuit design, not visual or multimedia content.
6. **ISCO 2511 (Systems analysts):** This is not a good fit. The job focuses on the physical design of analog circuits, while systems analysts deal with software, data, and business processes.
7. **ISCO 2523 (Computer network professionals):**  This is not relevant. The job is about circuit design, not computer networks.
8. **ISCO 3114 (Electronics engineering technicians):** While the job involves technical tasks, the "Senior" title, required Master's degree, and emphasis on innovation point to a higher level of expertise and autonomy than typically associated with a technician role.
9. **ISCO 3155 (Air traffic safety electronics technicians):** This is completely unrelated to the job advertisement.
10. **ISCO 8212 (Electrical and electronic equipment assemblers):** This is not relevant. The job focuses on designing circuits, not assembling pre-designed components.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2152
**ISCO Title:** Electronics engineer
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly emphasizes the design of electronic components (ADCs, DACs, etc.) for FPGAs, requiring expertise in analog circuit design, simulation, and semiconductor processes. This aligns perfectly with the core tasks and skillset of an Electronics Engineer.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3114, 2151, 2511 

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

While ISCO 2152 is the most fitting, here's why the alternatives could be considered with lower confidence:

* **3114 (Electronics engineering technicians):**  If the job emphasized hands-on testing and less design autonomy, this could be a possibility.
* **2151 (Electrical engineer):**  With a broader scope, this could encompass the job, but 2152 is more specific and accurate.
* **2511 (Systems analysts):**  Highly unlikely, but if the FPGA design involved significant software-hardware interaction beyond typical analog design, it might be distantly relevant.

Response:
## Reasoning Process:

1. **ISCO 2212 (Specialist medical practitioners)**: While the job requires knowledge of pharmaceutical products and their applications, the sales representative is not diagnosing or treating patients. This role doesn't require a medical degree, which is mandatory for this ISCO unit. Therefore, this is not a suitable match.

2. **ISCO 2262 (Pharmacists)**: Although the job involves knowledge of pharmaceutical products, the sales representative is not dispensing medication or counseling patients on drug usage. Their primary role is sales, not pharmaceutical practice. This ISCO unit is not a match.

3. **ISCO 2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals)**: This unit aligns perfectly with the job advertisement. The description explicitly mentions "Sales representative (medical and pharmaceutical products)" as an example occupation. The tasks listed, such as visiting clients, assessing needs, recommending products, and negotiating contracts, directly correspond to the responsibilities outlined in the job ad. 

4. **No further analysis is needed.**  We have a strong match with ISCO 2433. The remaining ISCO units are not relevant as they focus on ICT sales, pharmaceutical technician roles, general commercial sales, shop sales, sales demonstrations, door-to-door sales, and contact center sales. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2433
**ISCO Title:** Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT)
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a sales role within the medical and pharmaceutical field, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO unit 2433.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed due to the strong match with ISCO 2433.

* The advertisement explicitly mentions "INSEGNANTI DELLA SCUOLA D’INFANZIA" which directly translates to "Kindergarten Teachers".
* This suggests a focus on early childhood education.

**2. Responsibilities & Tasks:**

* The advertisement lists responsibilities like "progettazione percorsi educativi" (designing educational paths) and "realizzazione attività educative" (carrying out educational activities). 
* These align strongly with the tasks described for ISCO 2342: Early Childhood Educators, who focus on developing motor, social, and intellectual skills in children below primary school age.

**3. Skills & Qualifications:**

* The advertisement requires a "Laurea in Scienze della Formazione Primaria" (Bachelor's degree in Primary Education) or equivalent. This qualification is typical for early childhood educators.
*  Additional required competencies like "gestione delle relazioni con genitori ed esperti" (managing relationships with parents and experts) also fall under the scope of an early childhood educator (see ISCO 2342 - task (h)).

**4. Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

* ISCO 2342 (Early Childhood Educators) falls under:
    * Major Group 2: Professionals
    * Sub-major Group 23: Teaching Professionals 
* This categorization accurately reflects the professional and educational nature of the advertised position.

**Reasoning:**

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7411
**ISCO Title:** Building and related electricians 
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** This job advertisement very clearly aligns with the ISCO unit 7411 - Building and related electricians. 

* **Job Title & Description Match:** The job title explicitly states "Electricians," and the description details tasks like installing containment, lighting, power, and 2nd fix work, all core duties of building electricians.
* **Responsibilities & Tasks:** The advertised responsibilities directly match the tasks outlined in ISCO 7411, such as installing wiring systems, working with fixtures, and understanding building-specific electrical work.
* **Skills & Qualifications:** The requirement for a JIB card (a UK construction industry qualification) and commercial/industrial experience further solidifies this classification, indicating expertise expected of building electricians.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title and Description Analysis:** The job title is "Permanent Veterinary Surgeon". This immediately points towards ISCO unit **2250: Veterinarians**, as the title "Veterinarian" and "Veterinary Surgeon" are very similar and frequently used interchangeably. 

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job description emphasizes surgical skills ("confident in all areas of routine surgeries", "wide variety of surgical services"), medical case management, and client communication. These tasks align perfectly with the description provided for **2250: Veterinarians**, which includes treating animals medically and surgically, advising clients on animal health, and diagnosing and treating diseases.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires an RCVS registered and qualified individual, implying a specific veterinary education. This further strengthens the classification within **2250: Veterinarians**, as this level of qualification is consistent with the ISCO unit's definition.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO unit **2250** falls under:
    - Major group **2: Professionals** - This fits as the job requires a high level of education and specialized knowledge.
    - Sub-major group **22: Health Professionals** -  This is a perfect match, as the job directly involves animal health.

5. **Comparison with other ISCO units:** While other units mention animal care, none encompass the scope and required qualifications as accurately as **2250: Veterinarians**. For example:
    - **3240: Veterinary technicians and assistants** assist veterinarians but lack the autonomy and decision-making responsibility outlined in the ad.
    - **5164: Pet groomers and animal care workers** focus on basic care and grooming, lacking the medical and surgical expertise required.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2250
**ISCO Title:** Veterinarians
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required qualifications, and tasks all strongly indicate that this position aligns perfectly with the ISCO unit 2250: Veterinarians. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as the provided ISCO unit 2250: Veterinarians is a perfect match.

## ISCO Code Analysis: Domestic Operative - Band 2

**1. Analyzing the top ISCO unit:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 3221**
* **ISCO Title:** Nursing associate professionals 

**Reasoning:**

* While the job is located in a hospital setting, the description focuses entirely on cleaning and housekeeping tasks. There is no mention of providing nursing care, administering medication, or assisting with medical procedures. This strongly suggests the role is not related to nursing. 

**Conclusion:** ISCO code 3221 is not a good fit. 

**2. Analyzing the second ISCO unit:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 5151**
* **ISCO Title:** Cleaning and housekeeping supervisors

**Reasoning:**

* The job advertisement mentions "Domestic Operative" and focuses on cleaning tasks like "keeping our hospital clean," "trained in all aspects of cleaning," and "trained to use specialist equipment." This aligns with the cleaning and housekeeping functions described in ISCO 5151. 
* However, there's no mention of supervisory responsibilities like managing staff, purchasing supplies, or training new employees. 

**Conclusion:** While ISCO code 5151 is closer to the job description than 3221, the lack of supervisory duties makes it not a perfect match.

**3. Analyzing the remaining ISCO units:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 5152** - **Domestic Housekeepers:** This code focuses on private households and small establishments. The job ad clearly states the position is within a hospital, making this code unsuitable.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 5321** - **Health Care Assistants:** This code involves direct patient care under the supervision of medical professionals. The job ad solely focuses on cleaning duties, making this code unsuitable.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 5329** - **Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services:** This code encompasses various health and personal care support roles. However, the specific tasks listed in the code don't align with the cleaning-focused duties in the job ad.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 9111** - **Domestic Cleaners and Helpers:** This code focuses on domestic cleaning in private homes. The job ad clearly states the position is within a hospital, making this code unsuitable.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 9112** - **Cleaners and Helpers in offices, hotels and other establishments:** This code perfectly aligns with the job description. It involves cleaning tasks in establishments like hospitals, specifically mentioning cleaning floors, furniture, bathrooms, and kitchens.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 9129** - **Other Cleaning Workers:** This code focuses on specialized cleaning tasks using specific equipment and chemicals. The job ad doesn't mention such specialized cleaning, making this code less suitable.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 9613** - **Sweepers and related labourers:** This code focuses on cleaning public places like streets and parks. The job ad clearly states the position is within a hospital, making this code unsuitable.
* **ISCO Code (unit code): 9622** - **Odd-job persons:** This code involves maintenance, repairs, and simple building tasks. The job ad solely focuses on cleaning duties, making this code unsuitable.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 9112
* **ISCO Title:** Cleaners and Helpers in offices, hotels and other establishments
* **Confidence:** 0.9 
* **Reasoning:** The job description explicitly focuses on cleaning tasks within a hospital setting, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks listed under ISCO code 9112.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Excavator Driver".  The description emphasizes environmental work, but the core task is operating an excavator for tasks like digging channels, building riverbeds, and landscaping. 

2. **Compare to ISCO descriptions:**
    * **8342 (Earthmoving and related plant operators):** This code perfectly matches the job description. The tasks listed directly relate to operating excavators and similar machinery for earthmoving and landscaping. 
    * **Other ISCO options:** The remaining ISCO options are not relevant. They involve civil engineering (design, not operation), underwater work, mining, well drilling, truck driving, farm work, crane operation, or manual labor. None of these align with the core duties of an excavator driver.

3. **Consider skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires an experienced excavator driver with a CPCS card (a certification for plant machinery operators). This further supports the selection of ISCO 8342.

4. **Major/Sub-major/Minor group alignment:** ISCO 8342 falls under:
    * Major: 8 - Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
    * Sub-major: 83 - Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators
    * This categorization is a precise fit for an excavator driver role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8342
**ISCO Title:** Earthmoving and related plant operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job description focuses on operating an excavator for environmental construction and landscaping tasks. This aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO 8342. The required skills and qualifications further support this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO 8342 is a strong and accurate match. No alternatives are needed.

## ISCO Unit Analysis for "Главен експерт-психолог в ДСП Слатина"

Here's a breakdown of the job advertisement analysis to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation and Understanding:**

The job title translates to "Lead Expert-Psychologist" in English. The advertisement is for a psychologist position within the Social Assistance Directorate in Slatina, Bulgaria. The role focuses on providing psychological support and counseling to children and families at risk.

**2. Responsibilities & Tasks:**

* Conducting individual and group psychological work with children, parents, and families.
* Maintaining detailed records of sessions and consultations.
* Collaborating with specialists from other institutions.

**3. Skills & Qualifications:**

* Bachelor's degree required.
* 2+ years of professional experience and/or specific junior rank preferred.
* Strong analytical, communication, and interpersonal skills.
* Client-focused approach.
* Digital competency.

**4. ISCO Unit Evaluation:**

Let's analyze the provided ISCO units in descending order of relevance:

* **1112 - Senior Government Officials:** This unit is irrelevant. The role is not focused on advising the government or overseeing policy implementation. 
* **1341 - Child Care Services Managers:** While the role involves working with children, it's not a management position overseeing a childcare center. Thus, this unit is not suitable.
* **2422 - Policy Administration Professionals:** This unit doesn't fit. The role is about providing direct psychological services, not developing or analyzing policies.
* **2423 - Personnel and Careers Professionals:** This unit is irrelevant. The role doesn't involve HR functions like recruitment or training.
* **2632 - Sociologists, Anthropologists and Related Professionals:** This unit is not a match. The focus is on practical psychological work, not sociological research or analysis.
* **2634 - Psychologists:** This unit aligns perfectly. The job description emphasizes psychological work with children and families, requiring a strong understanding of human behavior and mental processes. The tasks align with those of a psychologist.
* **2635 - Social Work and Counselling Professionals:** While there's overlap with social work in terms of the target group (families at risk), the core responsibilities and required qualifications point more strongly towards a psychologist's expertise.
* **3333 - Employment Agents and Contractors:** This unit is completely irrelevant. The role has no connection to employment services.
* **3353 - Government Social Benefits Officials:** This unit doesn't fit. The role isn't about determining benefit eligibility but providing direct psychological support.
* **3412 - Social Work Associate Professionals:** This unit is less suitable than 2634 (Psychologists). While the role involves assisting families, the advertised position requires a higher level of expertise and autonomy, aligning more with a professional psychologist role.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2634
* **ISCO Title:** Psychologists
* **Confidence:** 0.95
* **Reasoning:** The job description explicitly seeks a "psychologist" to provide direct services to children and families, aligning with the core duties and required expertise of ISCO unit 2634. 

* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2635, 3412, 3353 
    * While less precise, these units could be considered as alternatives due to the social service aspect of the role. However, 2634 remains the most accurate classification.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title & Description Analysis:** The job title "Door To Door Sales" and the description clearly indicate that the role involves approaching potential customers in their homes to sell renewable energy solutions. This strongly aligns with the definition and tasks described for **ISCO Code 5243: Door-to-door salespersons**. 

2. **Responsibilities & Tasks:** The advertisement lists responsibilities such as identifying suitable homes, discussing renewable energy options, and making sales. These tasks are explicitly mentioned within the detailed description of ISCO 5243.

3. **Skills & Qualifications:** The advertisement emphasizes that experience is not essential, highlighting that full training is provided. This suggests the role doesn't require advanced technical expertise, aligning with the skill level 2 (medium) assigned to ISCO 5243.

4. **Major, Sub-major & Minor Groups:** ISCO 5243 falls under:
    - **Major group 5: Services and Sales Workers** - This accurately reflects the core function of the advertised role.
    - **Sub-major group 52: Sales Workers** -  Further specifies the sales-oriented nature of the job.

5. **Alternative ISCO Units:** Given the strong alignment with ISCO 5243, exploring alternative codes is unnecessary. The provided description and tasks within ISCO 5243 comprehensively encompass the advertised role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5243
**ISCO Title:** Door-to-door salespersons
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:**  The job advertisement explicitly describes a door-to-door sales role, directly matching the definition, tasks, and skill level of ISCO 5243.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2120 (Mathematicians, Actuaries and Statisticians):** This unit is a strong match. The job title explicitly mentions "Actuary," and the description emphasizes capital modeling, premium and reserve risk parameterization, and presenting results to senior management. These tasks align with the core responsibilities outlined in the ISCO 2120 description, particularly applying mathematical and statistical principles to financial risk assessment.

2. **Other ISCO Units:**  While ISCO 2120 is a very strong match, let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

    * **ISCO 2413 (Financial Analysts):**  While this role involves financial analysis, it focuses more broadly on investment recommendations and market trends. The Actuary (Capital Modelling) position is more specialized in assessing risk and building financial models within the insurance context. 
    * **ISCO 2421 (Management and Organization Analysts):** This unit focuses on improving organizational efficiency and processes, which is not the primary focus of the advertised role.
    * **ISCO 2422 (Policy Administration Professionals):** This unit deals with developing and analyzing policies, which is not directly relevant to the Actuary position.
    * **ISCO 2511 (Systems Analysts):** This unit focuses on IT systems analysis and development, which is not a core aspect of the advertised role.
    * **ISCO 3314 (Statistical, Mathematical and Related Associate Professionals):** This unit represents a lower skill level and typically involves assisting actuaries or statisticians. The advertised role requires a qualified or nearly qualified actuary, indicating a higher level of expertise.
    * **ISCO 3315 (Valuers and Loss Assessors):** This unit focuses on assessing the value of property and losses, which is not the primary focus of the advertised role.
    * **ISCO 3321 (Insurance Representatives):** This unit focuses on selling insurance policies, while the advertised role is more technical and analytical.
    * **ISCO 3333 (Employment Agents and Contractors):** This unit is entirely unrelated to the advertised role.
    * **ISCO 4312 (Statistical, Finance and Insurance Clerks):** This unit represents a lower skill level and primarily involves clerical tasks, while the advertised role requires a higher level of expertise and autonomy.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2120
**ISCO Title:** Mathematicians, Actuaries and Statisticians
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title explicitly mentions "Actuary," and the description strongly emphasizes responsibilities directly related to actuarial science, particularly capital modeling and risk assessment within the insurance industry. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  2413, 3314, 3315

Response:
## Job Advertisement Analysis:

**1. Translation & Initial Observations:**

* **Job Title (Translated):** Job Posting for Veterinary Nurses
* **Job Description (Translated):**  We would like to present job openings for the hiring of veterinary nurses, for immediate admission.  Please send a resume to this same email.

* **Observations:** The advertisement is very brief. We can infer the role involves typical veterinary nurse duties. 

**2. Matching with Provided ISCO Units:**

* **2131 - Biologists, Botanists, Zoologists and Related Professionals:**  This is not a match. While veterinary nurses work with living organisms, their focus is on animal healthcare, not scientific research or broad biological studies.

* **2250 - Veterinarians:** This is not a match. The advertisement explicitly states "veterinary nurses," a distinct profession from veterinarians. 

* **3240 - Veterinary Technicians and Assistants:** This is a strong match. The title "Veterinary Nurse" is a common synonym for Veterinary Technician. The description implies direct animal care, aligning with this unit's tasks.

**3. Reasoning:**

* The job title "Veterinary Nurse" directly corresponds to roles within ISCO unit 3240.
* Though the description is limited, the phrase "immediate admission" suggests a hands-on, care-giving role, typical of Veterinary Technicians and Assistants.
* The other provided ISCO units are not relevant to animal healthcare or are a higher professional level (Veterinarians).

**4. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 3240
* **ISCO Title:** Veterinary Technicians and Assistants
* **Confidence:** 0.9 
* **Reasoning:**  The job title directly matches the ISCO unit, and the limited description implies duties consistent with this profession.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The match with 3240 is strong enough that alternatives are not necessary.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title:** "Senior Full Stack Application Developer" suggests a role focused on software development across all layers of an application, aligning with the description. This immediately points towards ISCO units within the "Software and Applications Developers and Analysts" category.

2. **Review key responsibilities:** The job ad emphasizes designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining software applications. This aligns strongly with the tasks described for ISCO code **2512 - Software Developers**. 

3. **Evaluate required skills:** The listing requires expertise in various technologies like Spring, Java, JavaScript, and experience with databases, microservices, and cloud technologies. These are all core skills expected of a **Software Developer (2512)**.

4. **Consider experience level:** The requirement of 5+ years of experience, preferably in a tech lead role, further supports classifying this position as a **Software Developer (2512)**, which falls under the "Professionals" major group and requires a high skill level.

5. **Analyze other potential ISCO units:** While the job mentions testing and collaborating with testers, it doesn't represent the core focus. Therefore, **2519 - Software and Applications Developers and Analysts not elsewhere classified** is less accurate. Similarly, other listed ISCO units focus on management, training, or specific technical niches, not reflecting the core responsibilities of this role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2512
**ISCO Title:** Software Developers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on full-stack software development, requiring expertise in various technologies and methodologies directly aligning with the definition and tasks of a Software Developer (2512).

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2519, 3512, 2529

## Job Advertisement Analysis: Karenzvertretung als Schreibkraft für die MA 5/01 - Baurechtsamt

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation and Summary:**

The job title translates to "Maternity Leave Replacement as a Typist for the MA 5/01 - Building Authority". This is a temporary, full-time position in Salzburg, Austria.

**2. Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* Secretarial work supporting administrative staff
* Scheduling and organizing meetings
* Record-keeping for building and environmental authority proceedings
* General typing and writing tasks

**3. Required Skills and Qualifications:**

* Completed commercial training
* Excellent written and spoken German
* Ten-finger typing system proficiency
* Strong computer skills

**4. Analysis of Potential ISCO Units:**

* **4131 - Scribes and related workers:** While the job involves writing, it's not on behalf of others who can't read or write. This ISCO unit doesn't fit.

* **4120 - Secretaries (general):** This unit aligns well with the job description. The tasks of typing, document formatting, mail handling, and administrative support are all core responsibilities. 

* **4110 - General office clerks:**  This unit is less specific than 4120 and focuses on broader clerical tasks. While there's overlap, the job description emphasizes typing and administrative support more prominently.

* **3344 - Medical secretaries:** This unit is irrelevant as the job isn't in a medical setting.

* **3343 - Administrative and executive secretaries:** This unit requires a higher level of autonomy and decision-making than the advertised position. The job description emphasizes support tasks rather than independent coordination.

* **3342 - Legal secretaries:** This unit is irrelevant as the job is not in a legal setting.

* **3341 - Office supervisors:** This unit is not a match as the job doesn't involve supervising other clerical workers.

**5. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 4120
* **ISCO Title:** Secretaries (general)
* **Confidence:** 0.9
* **Reasoning:** The job responsibilities align strongly with the tasks and skills outlined for Secretaries (general). The focus on typing, document processing, and administrative support makes this the most appropriate ISCO unit.

* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 4110, 4419, 4416 
    * While less specific, these units could be considered due to the general clerical nature of some tasks. However, 4120 remains the most accurate classification.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "Senior Quantity Surveyor" directly matches a "Similar job title" under ISCO Code 2149: Engineering Professionals not elsewhere classified. This is a strong initial indicator.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job advertisement lists responsibilities like negotiating costs, drawing up contracts (NEC and JCT), monthly reporting (CVR), managing change control, dealing with pricing variations, re-measuring projects, preparing final accounts, and managing CE's. These tasks align strongly with the description of a Quantity Surveyor, particularly within the construction industry. 

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The required skills (IT, maths, attention to detail, report writing, negotiation) and qualifications (Degree/HND in Quantity Surveying, experience with NEC and JCT contracts) are all typical for a Quantity Surveyor.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO Code 2149 falls under:

Response:
The job advertisement provides very limited information, only stating the title: "Apsargs Inčukalnā!". 

1. **Translation & Interpretation:** "Apsargs" in Latvian translates to "Guard" in English. "Inčukalnā" refers to Inčukalns, a town in Latvia.  Therefore, the job title likely refers to a Guard position in Inčukalns.

2. **Analyzing Potential ISCO Units:**

    * **5414 - Security Guards:** This is the most relevant ISCO unit based on the limited information.  Security guards often work in specific locations, and the title "Guard" aligns with this occupation. 
    * **5413 - Prison Guards:**  While "Guard" could refer to a prison guard, the location "Inčukalnā" suggests a more general location than a specific prison.
    * **5412 - Police Officers:**  Police officers are also referred to as "officers" rather than "guards." Their duties are broader than guarding a specific location. 
    * **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining ISCO units are less relevant. They involve different tasks and responsibilities that don't align with the limited information provided.

3. **Alternative ISCO Units:**

    Given the limited information, it's difficult to be certain. Here are three alternative ISCO units that could be relevant depending on the specific type of guard:

    * **5419 - Protective Services Workers Not Elsewhere Classified:** This unit encompasses a broader range of protective services, potentially including specialized guard roles.
    * **9629 - Elementary Workers Not Elsewhere Classified:**  If the guard role involves basic tasks like checking IDs or monitoring entry/exit, this unit might be relevant.
    * **5153 - Building Caretakers:** If the guard is responsible for a building in Inčukalns, this unit could be a possibility. 

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 5414
* **ISCO Title:** Security Guards
* **Confidence:** 0.6 
* **Reasoning:**  The job title "Apsargs" translates to "Guard," and the location "Inčukalnā" suggests a specific place. This aligns with the typical responsibilities of a Security Guard. However, the lack of detailed information limits the confidence level.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 5419, 9629, 5153 
 
**Important Note:**  It's crucial to obtain a more detailed job description to make a more accurate ISCO unit assignment.

   **ISCO Title:** **Accounting and bookkeeping clerks**
   **Confidence:** 0.5
   **Reasoning:** While the job ad doesn't heavily emphasize bookkeeping, managing customer accounts and handling invoices fall under this category's broader scope.

Job Ad ID: 844693688, Row: 25550, Pred: 5321, 3221, 3222, 5322, 3256, 3344, 3343, 4416, 3259, 5329
Response:
## Reasoning Process:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Personal Assistant," and the description emphasizes administrative support and diary management for senior staff. This aligns strongly with the description and tasks listed under ISCO Code 3343: Administrative and Executive Secretaries. 

2. **Review key responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists tasks such as handling correspondence, organizing meetings, preparing documents (agendas, minutes, reports), and managing travel arrangements. These tasks are all explicitly mentioned within the description of ISCO Code 3343.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad emphasizes skills like diary management, drafting correspondence, producing reports, and excellent communication (written and oral). These skills directly correspond with the expertise expected of an Administrative or Executive Secretary (ISCO 3343).

4. **Evaluate Major, Sub-major, and Minor groups:** ISCO 3343 falls under:
    - **Major group 3:** Technicians and Associate Professionals - This aligns well, as the role requires specialized skills and knowledge.
    - **Sub-major group 33:** Business and Administration Associate Professionals - This is a precise match, confirming the job's administrative and business support nature. 

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:** While some tasks might appear in other listed ISCO units, none encompass the full range of responsibilities and the required skillset as comprehensively as ISCO 3343. For instance:
    - Medical secretaries (3344) share some administrative tasks but focus on medical terminology and healthcare procedures, not relevant here.
    - Personnel clerks (4416) deal specifically with personnel records and HR processes, a subset of the Personal Assistant's broader duties.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3343
**ISCO Title:** Administrative and Executive Secretaries
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement's emphasis on administrative support, diary management, correspondence, and meeting organization, along with the required communication and organizational skills, strongly indicates this role aligns with the tasks and expertise of an Administrative or Executive Secretary.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO code 3343 is a strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 1221: Sales and Marketing Managers:** While the job title includes "Market," the description focuses heavily on research and insights, not sales activities like setting prices or managing sales teams. This unit is a poor fit.

2. **ISCO 1223: Research and Development Managers:** This unit aligns with the research focus. However, the job description emphasizes consumer and market insights to guide product development, not directly managing the R&D process itself. This unit is a possible fit but not the most accurate.

3. **ISCO 1321: Manufacturing Managers:** This unit is irrelevant. The job is about understanding consumer needs and market trends, not managing production processes.

4. **ISCO 2141: Industrial and Production Engineers:** This unit is also irrelevant. The focus here is on engineering and optimizing production, not market research and consumer insights.

5. **ISCO 2144: Mechanical Engineers:** This unit is completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

6. **ISCO 2145: Chemical Engineers:** This unit is also completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

7. **ISCO 2151: Electrical Engineers:** This unit is completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

8. **ISCO 2152: Electronics Engineers:** This unit is completely unrelated to the job advertisement.

9. **ISCO 2431: Advertising and Marketing Professionals:** This unit aligns strongly with the job description. The focus on market research, consumer insights, identifying market opportunities, and developing strategies to reach target markets are all core responsibilities listed. 

10. **ISCO 4227: Survey and Market Research Interviewers:** This unit focuses on the data collection aspect of market research. While the manager might oversee some data collection, their role is broader, encompassing strategy and analysis. This unit is too narrow.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2431
**ISCO Title:** Advertising and Marketing Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** This job focuses on understanding consumers, analyzing market trends, and developing strategies based on these insights, aligning perfectly with the "Advertising and Marketing Professionals" unit.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1223, 2423, 3111
**Reasoning for Alternatives:** 
* **1223 (Research and Development Managers):**  While not directly managing R&D, the role heavily influences it through insights.
* **2423 (Public Relations and Communications Professionals):** Communicating findings and shaping brand perception is likely part of the role.
* **3111 (Business and Administration Professionals not elsewhere classified):**  If a more specific marketing-focused unit isn't available, this broader category could apply.

Job Ad ID: 874881846, Row: 25548, Pred: 2267, 3254, 3214, 7549, 2433, 2266, 2423, 5242, 2261, 3251
Response:
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation and Summary:**

First, let's translate the job advertisement from Romanian to English:

**Title:** Optometrist

**Description:** Optometrist/Medical Device Provider is hiring staff for an optical practice. 
**Requirements:** 
- Qualified personnel with a diploma 
- Communication and sales skills 
- Ambitious person eager for professional development 
**Job Description:** 
- Performing optometric consultations 
- Presenting to patients the types of frames, lenses and their characteristics 
- Ensures the relationship between patients and the company's departments; 
- Call center activity 
**Salary and benefits** 
- attractive salary - negotiable following the interview 
- meal vouchers 
- sales commission 
- company phone 
- pleasant working environment

**2. Analysis:**

* **Job Title:** The title "Optometrist" directly matches ISCO unit **2267: Optometrists and ophthalmic opticians**. 
* **Main Responsibilities:** The description emphasizes performing eye consultations, prescribing corrective lenses (frames and lenses), and patient education. These tasks align strongly with the description of ISCO unit 2267.
* **Required Skills:** The ad requires strong communication skills, suggesting patient interaction and potentially sales. While 2267 includes advising on optical aids, the emphasis on "sales skills" and "sales commission" hints at a stronger sales component than typical for this ISCO unit.
* **Call Center Activity:** This task is atypical for an Optometrist and falls outside the scope of ISCO 2267. This suggests the role might be a hybrid.

**3. Reasoning:**

The core responsibilities of the advertised position clearly align with **ISCO unit 2267: Optometrists and ophthalmic opticians**. However, the inclusion of call center duties and a strong emphasis on sales suggest this role may involve additional responsibilities not traditionally associated with an Optometrist. 

**4. Final Prediction and Alternatives:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2267
**ISCO Title:** Optometrists and ophthalmic opticians
**Confidence:** 0.8 
**Reasoning:**  The primary duties are clearly those of an Optometrist. However, the sales focus and call center tasks lower the confidence level, as they indicate a potential blend of responsibilities.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 
1. **3254: Dispensing opticians:** If the role focuses heavily on selling and fitting prescribed eyewear based on existing prescriptions, with less emphasis on conducting eye exams, this unit may be more appropriate.
2. **5242: Sales demonstrators:** If the role prioritizes demonstrating and selling optical products with minimal clinical optometry work, this unit could be a fit.
3. **2433: Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT):** This option is less likely but possible if the role involves significant sales of specialized ophthalmic equipment to other businesses or healthcare professionals. 
 
**Note:** It's crucial to remember that job titles and descriptions can be fluid. A conversation with the employer would be necessary to confirm the exact balance of responsibilities and determine the most accurate ISCO code.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Tower Crane Operator" explicitly points to operating a crane. This aligns strongly with the ISCO unit **8343: Crane, hoist and related plant operators**. 

2. **Examine main responsibilities and tasks:** The description emphasizes interpreting plans (2D and 3D), following safety procedures, and reacting to time-critical events. These tasks are core responsibilities of crane operators on construction sites.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad mentions good communication, teamwork, and customer service orientation. While these are transferable skills, they are essential for crane operators who interact with ground crews and site managers.

4. **Evaluate ISCO unit descriptions:** 
    - ISCO 8343's description directly mentions operating stationary and mobile cranes, aligning perfectly with the job ad. 
    - While other ISCO units relate to construction (e.g., 1323, 3123), they focus on management or supervision, not direct crane operation.

5. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor groups:** ISCO 8343 falls under:
    - Major group 8: Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
    - Sub-major group 83: Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators
    - This categorization accurately reflects the job's nature.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8343
**ISCO Title:** Crane, hoist and related plant operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, and required skills all directly correspond to the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 8343. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO unit 8343 is a precise match, making alternatives unnecessary.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job ad clearly states "CPCS Telescopic Forklift Operator". This title directly relates to the operation of a specific type of machinery. 

2. **Examine provided ISCO units:**  We start analyzing the ISCO units in the provided order:
    * **7215 - Riggers and cable splicers:** This unit focuses on assembling rigging gear and installing/maintaining cables. It doesn't align with operating a telescopic forklift.
    * **8111 - Miners and quarriers:** This unit involves extracting resources from mines and quarries using various machinery. It's not relevant to the job ad.
    * **8113 - Well drillers and borers:** This unit focuses on operating drilling machinery for wells and extracting samples. It's not related to the advertised position.
    * **8114 - Cement, stone and other mineral products machine operators:** This unit involves operating machinery for manufacturing concrete, stone, and mineral products. It's not a match for a forklift operator.
    * **8341 - Mobile farm and forestry plant operators:** This unit focuses on operating machinery used in agriculture and forestry. It doesn't align with the construction site context of the job ad.
    * **8342 - Earthmoving and related plant operators:** This unit involves operating machinery for excavation and earthmoving tasks. While a telescopic forklift can be used on construction sites, its primary function isn't earthmoving.
    * **8343 - Crane, hoist and related plant operators:** This unit focuses on operating cranes and hoisting equipment. While a telescopic forklift has lifting capabilities, it's a distinct type of machinery with different applications. 
    * **8344 - Lifting truck operators:** This unit directly mentions "forklift truck driver" as an example occupation. The tasks described, such as loading, unloading, transporting, and stacking goods, perfectly match the responsibilities outlined in the job ad.

3. **Evaluate skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires a valid CPCS Telescopic Forklift Operator card, indicating specific training and certification for operating this machinery. This aligns with the skillset and qualifications expected of a Lifting truck operator.

4. **Consider major/sub-major groups:** ISCO unit 8344 falls under Major group 8 (Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers) and Sub-major group 83 (Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators). This categorization accurately reflects the nature of the advertised position.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
**ISCO Title:** Lifting truck operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills (CPCS card), and industry context strongly indicate that the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement is 8344 - Lifting truck operators.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided 8344 is a very strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job title analysis:** The job title is "Audiologist." This title directly matches one of the example occupations listed in ISCO unit **2266: Audiologists and speech therapists**. 

2. **Job description analysis:** The job description mentions tasks like instructing on the use of hearing aids and complying with healthcare legislation. These tasks align with the description of ISCO unit **2266**, which includes prescribing hearing aids and counseling on hearing safety.

3. **Skills and qualifications analysis:** The job ad requires an awareness of confidentiality, efficiency, accuracy, proactivity, team spirit, and the ability to work autonomously. These skills are typical for health professionals, aligning with the skill group of ISCO unit **2266** (Managers, professionals, and technicians).

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor group analysis:** ISCO unit **2266** falls under Major group **2: Professionals**, Sub-major group **22: Health Professionals**. This categorization is appropriate for an Audiologist role.

5. **Alternative ISCO units:**  Given the strong match with ISCO unit 2266, exploring alternative ISCO codes is unnecessary.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2266
**ISCO Title:** Audiologists and speech therapists
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and qualifications strongly align with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 2266. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

Job Ad ID: 873621997, Row: 25544, Pred: 2221, 3221, 5321, 5322, 1343, 2222, 5329, 3222, 2240, 3259
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Staff Nurse". This title is very similar to "Professional Nurse" and appears under the "Similar job titles" for ISCO code 2221: Nursing Professionals.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job ad lists responsibilities such as managing and implementing care plans, administering medication, leading a team of HCAs, and ensuring high-quality care delivery. These tasks align strongly with the description of Nursing Professionals (2221) who provide care, manage patient care, and supervise other healthcare workers.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The job ad requires a registered nurse with RGN, RMN, or RNLD qualification, strong clinical skills, and ideally experience in elderly care. These qualifications and skills are typical requirements for Nursing Professionals (2221).

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO code 2221 falls under:
    - **Major group 2: Professionals:** This aligns with the requirement for a registered nursing qualification, signifying a professional level of expertise.
    - **Sub-major group 22: Health Professionals:** This accurately reflects the healthcare nature of the job. 

5. **Eliminating Other Options:**
    - **1343: Aged care services managers:** While the job is in an elderly care setting, the role focuses on direct patient care, not managerial duties like those described in 1343.
    - **2222: Midwifery Professionals:** This is irrelevant as the job focuses on elderly care, not pregnancy and childbirth.
    - **Other ISCO codes:** The remaining codes relate to associate professionals, assistants, or other healthcare roles that do not match the required qualifications and responsibilities of a Staff Nurse.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2221
**ISCO Title:** Nursing Professionals
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, responsibilities, required qualifications, and level of autonomy strongly indicate this is a Nursing Professional role. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO code 2221: Nursing Professionals is a perfect match. There is no need to consider alternative codes.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "Plastering and Roughcaster" directly points to tasks related to applying plaster and roughcast, aligning strongly with the description of ISCO unit **7123 - Plasterers**. 

2. **Description Analysis:** The job description emphasizes:
    * **Core Tasks:** "Carry out Plastering/Render/Roughcast" - These tasks are explicitly mentioned in the description of ISCO unit 7123.
    * **Experience:**  Requires at least three years of experience in plastering, further supporting the classification as a skilled plasterer (skill level 2 in ISCO 7123).
    * **Other Requirements:**  Working independently or as part of a team, maintaining professional standards, and client communication are common expectations for skilled trades workers, aligning with the general skillset of ISCO 7123.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** 
    * The advertisement prioritizes experience over specific certifications, implying practical skills are most important. This aligns with the emphasis on hands-on tasks within ISCO 7123.
    * While a driving license is preferred, it's not mandatory, and the core tasks don't inherently require it. This suggests the role is primarily on-site, focusing on plastering work.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:**
    * **Major Group 7 - Craft and Related Trades Workers:** This accurately reflects the hands-on, specialized nature of plastering.
    * **Sub-major Group 71 - Building and Related Trades Workers:** Plastering is a crucial trade within the construction industry, fitting this category. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7123
**ISCO Title:** Plasterers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required experience, and core tasks strongly indicate this role aligns with the definition and tasks of Plasterers (ISCO 7123). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A 

**Explanation for not providing alternatives:** The provided ISCO unit 7123 is a very strong match. It is unnecessary to suggest alternatives as the alignment is clear and there is no indication of tasks outside the scope of 7123.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Translation & Understanding:** The job advertisement is in Romanian and needs to be translated. The translated version describes a job for a "Machinist for Earthmoving Machinery" at the Crişuri Water Basin Administration in Oradea, Romania. The job requires a certificate of professional competence (C.I.M.) and involves operating earthmoving machinery.

2. **Matching with ISCO Descriptions:** 
    * **8342 (Earthmoving and related plant operators)** appears to be the most relevant ISCO unit based on the translated job title and the requirement to operate earthmoving machinery. The description also mentions tasks like excavating, grading, and leveling earth, which align with the job's nature.

3. **Confirming with Responsibilities:** While the advertisement doesn't detail specific tasks, the general description and the mention of "mașini pentru terasamente" (earthmoving machinery) strongly suggest the job involves operating such machinery for tasks related to water basin administration, like building dams, digging canals, or preparing the ground.

4. **Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement requires a "calificare de mașinist la mașini pentru terasamente" (qualification of a machinist for earthmoving machinery), which confirms the need for specialized skills in operating such machinery. This aligns with the skill level and group associated with ISCO unit 8342.

5. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO unit 8342 falls under:
    * **Major Group 8:** Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
    * **Sub-major Group 83:** Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators 
    
    This categorization accurately reflects the job's nature as it involves operating mobile, heavy machinery.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8342
**ISCO Title:** Earthmoving and related plant operators
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly mentions operating "mașini pentru terasamente" (earthmoving machinery) and requires a relevant qualification. This strongly suggests the job's alignment with the tasks and skills associated with ISCO unit 8342.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO code 8342 is a very strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 1412 (Restaurant Manager):** While the ad mentions career development up to managerial positions, the described responsibilities of a Kitchen Assistant do not align with the tasks of a Restaurant Manager. This role focuses on food preparation and hygiene, not managerial duties like planning menus, managing staff, or handling finances.

2. **ISCO 3434 (Chef):**  The Kitchen Assistant role lacks the required expertise and autonomy of a Chef.  Chefs design menus, manage kitchen staff, and create dishes. The ad emphasizes basic food preparation and hygiene, suggesting a more junior role.

3. **ISCO 5120 (Cook):** This unit is closer but still not a perfect fit. While "preparing foodstuffs" aligns with the Kitchen Assistant's tasks, Cooks typically have more autonomy and responsibility for planning and organizing meals. The ad suggests working under supervision, which is more indicative of a helper role.

4. **ISCO 5152 (Domestic Housekeeper), 5246 (Food Service Counter Attendant), 9111 (Domestic Cleaner), 9112 (Cleaner), 9212 (Livestock Farm Labourer):** These units are irrelevant and easily dismissed as they involve tasks and responsibilities entirely unrelated to the advertised position.

5. **ISCO 9411 (Fast Food Preparer):** This unit is a possibility as it involves preparing a limited range of foods and maintaining hygiene. However, the ad doesn't specify a limited menu or fast-paced environment typical of fast food. 

6. **ISCO 9412 (Kitchen Helper):** This unit aligns best with the job description. The listed tasks like assisting in food preparation, cleaning kitchen areas, and washing dishes directly correspond with the advertised responsibilities. The ad's emphasis on "team player" and working under supervision further supports this classification.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 9412
**ISCO Title:** Kitchen Helper
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly lists "Kitchen Assistant" as the position title and focuses on tasks like food preparation assistance, maintaining hygiene, and working within a team, all core responsibilities of a Kitchen Helper.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 9411, 5120, 1412

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5223
**ISCO Title:** Shop Sales Assistant
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** This job advertisement closely aligns with the description of a Shop Sales Assistant. The ad explicitly mentions a "Retail Sales Assistant" in a "boutique furniture shop," indicating a retail environment where customers directly purchase goods. The role likely involves customer interaction, product knowledge sharing, and sales processing, all core tasks of ISCO 5223. While a design background is considered a plus, it's not mandatory, suggesting the primary focus is on sales, not specialized design consultation.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 5211, 5242, 3432 

## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the Job Advertisement:**
    * **Title:** "Retail Sales Assistant" clearly points towards a retail-oriented sales role.
    * **Description:**  
        * Confirms a retail setting: "Boutique furniture shop."
        * Emphasizes sales: "Christmas/January sales period."
        * Mentions customer service and sales experience as preferred.
        * Design background is desirable but not essential.

2. **Evaluating Potential ISCO Units:**

    * **2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals):**  This is not a match. The job involves selling furniture in a retail setting, not specialized industrial, medical, or pharmaceutical goods.
    * **2434 (Information and communications technology (ICT) sales professionals):** This is also not a match. The shop sells furniture, not ICT products.
    * **3322 (Commercial sales representatives):** While closer, this is less likely. The ad emphasizes a retail environment directly serving the public, whereas commercial sales reps typically deal with businesses and organizations.
    * **3432 (Interior designers and decorators):**  While a design background is desirable, the ad prioritizes sales experience, making this a less likely match. The role doesn't seem to involve design consultation as a primary function. 
    * **5211 (Stall and market salespersons):** This is less likely as the job is in a fixed retail shop, not a temporary stall or market setting.
    * **5223 (Shop sales assistants):** This is the **most likely match**. The job title, retail environment, and emphasis on sales align perfectly with this ISCO unit's description.
    * **5242 (Sales demonstrators):** This is less likely. The ad doesn't mention demonstrating products as a primary function. 
    * **5243 (Door-to-door salespersons):** This is not a match. The job is based in a retail shop, not door-to-door.
    * **5244 (Sales workers not elsewhere classified):**  While a possibility, the strong match with 5223 makes this less likely.

3. **Alternative ISCO Codes:**

    While 5223 is the most likely match, here are three alternatives in descending order of relevance:
    * **5211 (Stall and market salespersons):** If the furniture shop operates as a pop-up during the sales period, this could be a possibility.
    * **5242 (Sales demonstrators):** If product demonstrations are a significant part of the role, this could be considered.
    * **3432 (Interior designers and decorators):** If the shop heavily emphasizes design consultation as part of the sales process, this could be a distant possibility.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Commercial Property Solicitor". This immediately points towards a legal profession focused on commercial property transactions. The provided ISCO units include two highly relevant options: "Lawyers" (2611) and "Legal and related associate professionals" (3411). 

2. **Description Analysis:** The job description emphasizes experience in handling commercial property transactions for various clients like developers, investors, and retailers.  The tasks involve expertise in areas like hotel transactions and residential development. This aligns strongly with the core duties of a lawyer specializing in commercial property law.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement requires a qualified solicitor with 3+ years of experience. This signifies a high level of legal expertise and autonomy, aligning with the skill level associated with ISCO code 2611 (Skill Level 3 and 4 - High).

4. **Eliminating Alternatives:**
    * **ISCO 3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** While this category includes legal professionals, it focuses on support roles like legal assistants and paralegals. The job advertisement clearly demands a qualified solicitor with experience, exceeding the typical responsibilities of this category. 
    * **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining ISCO units are not relevant to the legal profession and can be eliminated. They involve roles like personnel management, sales, real estate agents, and building caretakers.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
**ISCO Title:** Lawyers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks a "Commercial Property Solicitor" with significant experience. This aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO code 2611 - Lawyers. The required qualifications and level of autonomy further support this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3411, 3334, 2619

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Packaging Technician" suggests a technical role involving packaging processes. The description confirms this, focusing on packaging pharmaceutical products according to cGMP standards. 

2. **Review ISCO Code 2262 (Pharmacist):** While the job involves pharmaceuticals, it doesn't involve dispensing medication or counseling patients, which are core pharmacist duties. This ISCO code is not a match.

3. **Review ISCO Code 3111 (Chemical and Physical Science Technician):** This code focuses on research and analysis in a laboratory setting. The packaging technician role is primarily operational, not research-oriented. This ISCO code is not a match.

4. **Review ISCO Code 3141 (Life Science Technician):** Similar to 3111, this code emphasizes research and laboratory work with living organisms. This is not the primary focus of the packaging technician role. This ISCO code is not a match.

5. **Review ISCO Code 3142 (Agricultural Technician):** This code is irrelevant as it deals with agricultural practices and supporting agricultural scientists. This ISCO code is not a match.

6. **Review ISCO Code 3213 (Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants):** This code seems promising. The description mentions "performing a variety of tasks associated with dispensing medicinal products," which aligns with the packaging technician's role in a broader sense. However, the focus is on dispensing and assisting pharmacists, while the job ad emphasizes packaging and labeling. 

7. **Review ISCO Code 8131 (Chemical products plant and machine operators):** This code aligns well with the job description. The tasks involve operating and monitoring machines for mixing, processing, and packaging chemical products, which directly relates to the packaging technician's responsibilities.

8. **Review remaining ISCO Codes (8143, 8183, 9321, 9329):** These codes are less relevant. They focus on specific packaging materials (paper), hand packing, or general manufacturing labor, which doesn't fully encompass the technical aspects and cGMP environment described in the job ad.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8131
**ISCO Title:** Chemical products plant and machine operators 
**Confidence:** 0.8 
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly emphasizes operating machinery to package pharmaceutical products, aligning with the core tasks of this ISCO code. The focus on cGMP standards and procedures further supports this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3213, 9329, 8183 

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

* **3213 (Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants):** While not a perfect fit, this code could be considered due to the pharmaceutical context. However, it lacks the emphasis on machine operation present in the job ad.
* **9329 (Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified):**  This code is a more general classification and could be used if a more specific code doesn't fully match. However, it doesn't reflect the technical aspects of the role.
* **8183 (Packing, bottling and labelling machine operators):** This code is less specific to pharmaceuticals and doesn't fully capture the technical requirements and regulated environment described in the job ad.

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2330
**ISCO Title:** Secondary Education Teachers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks an "Art and Design Teacher" for secondary and middle schools. The description emphasizes curriculum knowledge (KS3/KS4), UK teaching experience, and classroom management, aligning strongly with the tasks and definition of Secondary Education Teachers (ISCO 2330). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2355, 2352, 2341

## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2330 (Secondary Education Teachers):** This is a strong match. The job title, required qualifications, and described responsibilities align almost perfectly with the ISCO definition and tasks. The advertisement emphasizes curriculum knowledge specific to secondary education (KS3/KS4), which further solidifies this classification.

2. **ISCO 2341 (Primary School Teachers):** While the advertisement mentions middle schools, the overall focus on secondary education makes this a less likely match. The required KS3/KS4 knowledge is not typical for primary school teachers.

3. **ISCO 2351 (Education methods specialists):** This is not a good fit. The job advertisement focuses on teaching and classroom responsibilities, not research, curriculum development, or advising other teachers, which are core tasks of Education methods specialists.

4. **ISCO 2352 (Special needs teachers):**  The advertisement does not mention working with students with special needs. While an art and design teacher might adapt their teaching for diverse learners, it's not the primary focus of this position.

5. **ISCO 2354 (Other music teachers):** This is not relevant. The job explicitly seeks an art and design teacher, not a music teacher.

6. **ISCO 2355 (Other teaching professionals):** This could be a potential alternative if the position involved private tutoring or specialized art instruction outside a traditional school setting. However, the advertisement's emphasis on school experience and curriculum knowledge makes it less likely than ISCO 2330.

7. **ISCO 2651 (Visual artists):** This is not a match. While art teachers need artistic knowledge, this job focuses on teaching art, not creating it professionally as a Visual Artist would.

8. **ISCO 5312 (Teachers' aides):** This is not a match. The required qualifications and responsibilities clearly indicate a qualified teaching role, not an assistant position.

9. **ISCO 7316 (Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers):** This is not relevant. The job advertisement focuses on teaching art and design, not practicing a specific craft like signwriting or engraving.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Customer Contact Telesales Adviser." This title suggests a role focused on sales through telephone contact. The description confirms this, stating the role involves "contacting existing enquirers to encourage them to be transferred to a Sales Consultant to receive a quotation." 

2. **Review ISCO unit 5244: Contact centre salespersons:** This unit's description aligns strongly with the job ad. It involves contacting customers via telephone to promote goods and services, seeking sales or agreements for sales representatives. The tasks listed, such as creating interest and arranging appointments, match the job ad's description.

3. **Compare responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad emphasizes persuading potential customers to speak with a Sales Consultant, aligning with the promotional and appointment-setting aspects of ISCO 5244. 

4. **Assess required skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires excellent communication skills, computer literacy, and a "can-do" attitude, all consistent with the skills expected of a Contact Centre Salesperson (ISCO 5244).

5. **Consider the major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 5244 falls under Major Group 5: Services and Sales Workers, Sub-major Group 52: Sales Workers. This categorization accurately reflects the primary function of the advertised role.

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5244
**ISCO Title:** Contact centre salespersons 
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement's emphasis on telephone-based sales, appointment setting, and customer engagement strongly aligns with the definition and tasks associated with ISCO unit 5244: Contact centre salespersons.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2240 (Paramedical practitioners):** While the job requires healthcare knowledge, pharmacists operate under their own license and expertise. They don't work under the supervision of medical doctors as this ISCO unit suggests. This is not a match. 

2. **ISCO 2262 (Pharmacists):** This is a strong match. The job title explicitly states "Pharmacist," and the description aligns with the tasks outlined in this ISCO unit: dispensing medication, advising on drug interactions, and ensuring proper dosage. The required experience and license further solidify this match.

3. **No need to analyze further.**  Since ISCO 2262 is a clear and confident match, there's no need to analyze the remaining ISCO units. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2262
**ISCO Title:** Pharmacists
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required experience, and license directly align with the definition and tasks of a Pharmacist as described in ISCO unit 2262.

Job Ad ID: 723298529, Row: 25532, Pred: 1120, 1420, 1112, 1343, 1411, 2423, 1324, 1114, 1223, 1219
Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Job Title and Description:** The job title is "Retail Director," suggesting a managerial role within a retail setting. The description confirms this, emphasizing responsibilities like strategy execution, KPI monitoring, and overseeing various business units (purchasing, sales, customer service).

2. **Compare with Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **1112 (Senior Government Officials):** This is immediately irrelevant. The job is in a private company, not government.
    * **1114 (Senior Officials of Special-Interest Organizations):**  Also irrelevant. Autohero is a business, not a special interest group.
    * **1120 (Managing Directors and Chief Executives):**  While the role has high responsibility, the description focuses on a specific branch (Autohero Italy) within a larger corporation. This suggests a more focused role than a general CEO or Managing Director.
    * **1219 (Business Services and Administration Managers):**  This is less relevant. The core duties are about retail operations, not general administrative services.
    * **1223 (Research and Development Managers):** Not applicable. The job is about managing existing business operations, not research and development.
    * **1324 (Supply, Distribution and Related Managers):**  This has some overlap (inventory management is mentioned), but the role is broader than just supply chain. 
    * **1343 (Aged Care Services Managers):** Completely unrelated to the job advertisement.
    * **1411 (Hotel Managers):**  Also unrelated, despite some shared hospitality industry concepts.
    * **1420 (Retail and Wholesale Trade Managers):**  **This is the closest match.** The title, focus on sales, customer service, inventory, and overall branch management align strongly with this ISCO unit's description.
    * **2423 (Personnel and Careers Professionals):** While the role involves HR tasks (recruitment, training), these are presented as supporting functions, not the core of the job.

3. **Consider Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires a Master's degree in a business-related field, proven leadership, and experience in fast-paced environments. This aligns with the high skill level (3 or 4) expected of managers in ISCO unit 1420.

4. **Major, Sub-major, Minor Group Relevance:**
    * **Major Group 1 (Managers):**  A clear fit, as the role involves directing a team and making operational decisions.
    * **Sub-major 14 (Hospitality, Retail and Other Services Managers):** This aligns perfectly, as it's specifically about managing service-oriented businesses like retail.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1420
**ISCO Title:** Retail and Wholesale Trade Managers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement's title, description, required skills, and industry focus all strongly indicate this is a managerial role within the retail trade sector, aligning with ISCO unit 1420.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1120, 1324, 1219 

**Rationale for Alternatives:** While 1420 is the most likely, here's why the others are distant possibilities:

* **1120:** If Autohero Italy is very large and autonomous, this *could* be a Managing Director role, but the description doesn't suggest that level of independence.
* **1324:**  If the company places unusually high importance on the logistics aspect of their retail model, this could be a better fit, but it's not the primary focus.
* **1219:** This is a stretch, only applicable if the "Retail Director" title is misleading, and the role is more about internal business processes than customer-facing retail.

## ISCO Code Analysis: Plumber - Remedials - Water Hygiene

**1. Analyzing the provided ISCO units:**

* **2133 - Environmental Protection Professionals:** While water hygiene is related to environmental protection, this job focuses on the practical application of plumbing skills to remediate existing systems, not on research, impact assessment, or policy development. 
* **2143 - Environmental Engineers:** This is a closer match as it involves water quality and remediation. However, the job ad emphasizes plumbing experience and certifications, not an engineering background. It's unlikely this role involves designing systems or having the same depth of knowledge as an environmental engineer.
* **2263 - Environmental and Occupational Health and Hygiene Professionals:** This unit focuses on broader health and safety programs, not the hands-on remediation work described. 
* **3132 - Incinerator and Water Treatment Plant Operators:**  This unit involves operating large-scale treatment plants, while the job ad suggests work on individual properties ("servicing a variety of different properties"). The required skills are more operational than hands-on plumbing.
* **7126 - Plumbers and Pipe Fitters:** This is the **most relevant** unit. The job title explicitly mentions "Plumber," and the tasks (servicing TMVs, removing deadlegs, replacing tanks) align perfectly with typical plumbing duties. The required qualifications (Level 2 plumbing, experience as a Remedial Plumber) further confirm this.
* **7127 - Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Mechanics:** This unit is not relevant as it focuses on cooling systems, not water hygiene or plumbing.
* **7521 - Wood Treaters:** This unit is completely unrelated to the job ad.
* **7544 - Fumigators and Other Pest and Weed Controllers:** While Legionella control is mentioned in the keywords, it's not the primary focus. The job duties don't involve typical pest control tasks.
* **9129 - Other Cleaning Workers:** This unit is too general. While the job involves cleaning aspects, it requires specialized plumbing skills, placing it beyond general cleaning.
* **9622 - Odd-job Persons:** This unit is too broad and doesn't match the required skill level or specialization.

**2. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 7126
* **ISCO Title:** Plumbers and Pipe Fitters
* **Confidence:** 0.95
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, and required qualifications strongly align with the definition of a Plumber and Pipe Fitter, specifically focusing on remedial work and water hygiene within existing plumbing systems. 

**3. Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 

While 7126 is a strong match, here are alternative codes with decreasing relevance:

* **3132 - Incinerator and Water Treatment Plant Operators:** If the role involves more extensive work on larger water systems within buildings, this could be a possibility, though less likely.
* **2143 - Environmental Engineers:**  Highly unlikely, but if the role involves a significant degree of system design or analysis beyond typical plumbing tasks, this code might be considered. 
* **2263 - Environmental and Occupational Health and Hygiene Professionals:**  Only relevant if the plumbing work is a small part of a broader health and safety-focused role, which is not evident in the ad.

    * **Customer-focused service ethics:**  Suggests interaction with recipients of delivered goods.

4. **Analyzing Potential ISCO Units:**

    * **8311 - Locomotive Engine Drivers:**  This unit is immediately ruled out. The job involves driving an LGV, not a train.
    * **8321 - Motorcycle Drivers:**  Also ruled out. The job explicitly requires an LGV license, not a motorcycle license.
    * **8322 - Car, Taxi and Van Drivers:**  While this unit involves driving, the vehicle type and responsibilities don't align. The job description emphasizes heavy goods transport, not passenger or small-scale deliveries.
    * **8331 - Bus and Tram Drivers:**  Incorrect. The job involves goods transportation, not passenger transport on fixed routes.
    * **8332 - Heavy Truck and Lorry Drivers:** This unit aligns strongly with the job advertisement. It involves driving heavy vehicles ("lorry with or without trailer"), transporting goods ("to transport goods, liquids and heavy materials"), and ensuring safe delivery ("ensuring that goods are stowed and securely covered to prevent loss and damage").

5. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ISCO unit for this job advertisement is **8332 - Heavy Truck and Lorry Drivers**. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8332
**ISCO Title:** Heavy Truck and Lorry Drivers

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Private Client Solicitor". The description emphasizes managing a caseload of "private client matters including Wills, Powers of Attorney and Executries". This strongly suggests a legal professional specializing in civil law, particularly inheritance and estate planning.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO unit descriptions:**
    * **2412 - Financial and investment advisers:** While estate planning is mentioned, this ISCO unit focuses heavily on financial planning, investment management, and insurance. The job ad doesn't mention these responsibilities, making this unit less likely.
    * **2423 - Personnel and careers professionals:** This unit is entirely unrelated to the job ad, focusing on human resources and career guidance.
    * **2611 - Lawyers:** This unit's description perfectly aligns with the job ad. It mentions providing legal advice, drafting legal documents (wills are explicitly mentioned), and representing clients. The job ad's tasks fall squarely within this unit's scope.
    * **2619 - Legal professionals not elsewhere classified:** This unit is more general and covers legal professionals not fitting other categories. While the job ad involves legal work, the specific tasks and title ("Solicitor") are clearly defined within ISCO 2611, making this a less accurate fit.
    * **2635 - Social work and counselling professionals:** This unit is unrelated, focusing on social work, counselling, and community support. 
    * **3333 - Employment agents and contractors:** This unit focuses on connecting job seekers with employers and is not relevant to the job ad.
    * **3342 - Legal secretaries:** This unit involves providing administrative and secretarial support to legal professionals. While the job might require some interaction with legal support staff, the ad emphasizes the solicitor's direct responsibilities, making this unit inaccurate.
    * **3411 - Legal and related associate professionals:** This unit encompasses various legal support roles like paralegals and legal assistants. While the solicitor might work with such professionals, the ad focuses on a qualified lawyer's duties, making this unit less fitting.
    * **3412 - Social work associate professionals:** This unit is unrelated, focusing on social work support roles.
    * **5162 - Companions and valets:** This unit is completely unrelated, focusing on personal care and companionship services.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires a minimum of one year of experience managing private client matters, implying a law degree and bar admission are necessary. This further supports the selection of ISCO 2611.

4. **Analyze major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 2611 falls under:
    * Major group 2: Professionals
    * Sub-major group 26: Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals
    * Minor group 261: Legal Professionals
    These classifications accurately reflect the job's professional nature and specialization within the legal field.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
**ISCO Title:** Lawyers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a legal professional specializing in private client matters, aligning perfectly with the tasks, skills, and qualifications outlined for ISCO unit 2611 - Lawyers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are necessary as ISCO 2611 is a perfect match.

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Tester PLC (Renewable Energies)".  This immediately suggests a focus on testing within the renewable energy sector. The "(Renewable Energies)" specification might narrow down the field, but the core role seems to be related to testing.

2. **Description Analysis:** The translated description emphasizes software testing knowledge and experience.  Keywords like "SW testing campaigns," "test plans," "ALM tools," and "Automatic SW testing tools" all point towards a software-focused testing role.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The required skills heavily emphasize software development and testing methodologies.  While knowledge of programming languages like Python and C++ is considered valuable, the core requirements revolve around testing techniques, tools, and documentation.

4. **Matching with ISCO Units:**

    * **2519 - Software and Applications Developers and Analysts:** This unit explicitly includes professionals specializing in quality assurance and software testing. The tasks described (developing test plans, verifying functionality, documenting results) align perfectly with the job ad. The required skills in testing techniques, tools, and documentation further strengthen this match.

    * **Other ISCO Units:**  While the job involves the renewable energy sector, the core responsibilities don't align with the other provided ISCO units. These units focus on electrical or electronics engineering, power plant operation, or general technical assistance, which are not the primary focus of this job advertisement.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2519
**ISCO Title:** Software and Applications Developers and Analysts
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement heavily emphasizes software testing methodologies, tools, and processes.  The required skills align strongly with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for ISCO unit 2519, which explicitly includes software testers and quality assurance analysts.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  3113, 3114, 3119 
  
**Note:** While 2519 is the most accurate match, if the role involves a significant amount of hands-on work with PLC programming and testing within the renewable energy systems, alternative codes like 3113 (Electrical engineering technicians) or 3114 (Electronics engineering technicians) could be considered as secondary options. 3119 (Physical and engineering science technicians) is a more general category and might be relevant if the testing role involves broader aspects of renewable energy systems. However, the primary focus on software testing makes 2519 the most appropriate choice.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Singing Teacher." This directly matches similar job titles under ISCO code 2354: Other Music Teachers: "Teacher, singing: private tuition".

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job involves teaching singing to children aged 4-18, lesson planning, creating material for presentations, and coordinating show numbers. These tasks align strongly with the description of "Other Music Teachers" who instruct and demonstrate practical aspects of singing, plan and deliver lessons, and prepare students for performances.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires experience teaching children, a passion for teaching singing, and the ability to create innovative material. These align with the skills expected of "Other Music Teachers" who need to assess student abilities, plan engaging lessons, and adapt their teaching to different age groups.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO Code 2354 falls under:
    - **Major Group 2:** Professionals - This fits as teaching requires specialized knowledge and training.
    - **Sub-major Group 23:** Teaching Professionals - This is a perfect match as the core function is teaching. 
    - **Minor Group 235:** Other Teaching Professionals - This is appropriate as the teaching is specialized to singing and outside the formal school system.

5. **Other ISCO Units:** While other teaching units like "Secondary Education Teachers" (2330) might seem relevant, they are less specific to the private music instruction context. The job ad emphasizes teaching singing as a performing art, not a general school subject.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2354
**ISCO Title:** Other Music Teachers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:**  The job title, responsibilities, required skills, and context strongly align with the definition and tasks of "Other Music Teachers" within the ISCO classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are necessary as 2354 is a highly confident and accurate match.

Response:
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation and Initial Observations:**

* **Job Advertisement Translation:**
    * **Title:** Operating Room Nurses - Quironsalud Barcelona
    * **Description:**  Quironsalud Barcelona Hospital, a leading private healthcare center in southern Europe, located in an emblematic and well-connected area of the city of Barcelona, is looking to incorporate nurses for the Operating Room and Emergency Department.

    * **Offered:**
        * Permanent Contract
        * Competitive Salary
        * Professional development in the leading hospital group, sharing an environment with the best professionals in the sector
        * Social benefits
        * Special discounts for Quironsalud employees
        * Continuous training

    * **We are waiting for you!!**

* **Initial Observations:** The advertisement explicitly mentions "nurses" and specifies "Operating Room and Emergency Department." This strongly suggests a role directly involved in providing nursing care within a surgical/emergency context.

**2. Analyzing Potential ISCO Units:**

* **2221 - Nursing Professionals:**
    * **Match:** This unit has a very strong match. The description of nursing professionals aligns perfectly with the advertised role. The tasks listed (planning care, administering medication, monitoring patients) are all core responsibilities of operating room and emergency department nurses. 
    * **Job Titles:** The examples provided ("Operating theatre nurse," "Nurse anaesthetist") further solidify the match.
    * **Confidence Level:** High

* **Remaining ISCO Units:** Given the strong match with 2221, the remaining units are unlikely to be a better fit. Let's briefly analyze why:

    * **2240 - Paramedical Practitioners:** While working in a hospital setting, paramedical practitioners have a different scope. They often work autonomously or with limited supervision from doctors, focusing on more routine procedures. Operating room nurses work closely with surgeons and anesthesiologists in a highly specialized environment.
    * **2269 - Other Health Professionals:** This is a catch-all category for health professionals not fitting elsewhere. The specific nature of the advertisement and the strong match with 2221 make this unit less suitable.
    * **3221 - Nursing Associate Professionals:** These professionals provide basic nursing care under the supervision of registered nurses. The advertisement suggests a more independent and specialized role.
    * **3251 - Dental Assistants and Therapists:** This unit is clearly unrelated to the advertised nursing position.
    * **3258 - Ambulance Workers:** This unit focuses on pre-hospital emergency care and transport, not in-hospital operating room or emergency department settings.
    * **3259 - Other Health Associate Professionals:**  Similar to 2269, this is too general. The advertisement points to a specific type of nursing role.
    * **4229 - Other Client Information Workers:** This unit involves administrative and information-processing tasks, not direct patient care.
    * **5321 - Health Care Assistants:** These assistants provide basic care under close supervision. The advertisement implies a higher level of responsibility and expertise.
    * **5329 - Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services:** This unit includes roles like sterilization aids and hospital orderlies, which are distinct from nursing duties.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2221
* **ISCO Title:** Nursing Professionals
* **Confidence:** 0.95 
* **Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks nurses for an operating room and emergency department. The tasks, required skills, and context strongly align with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 2221 - Nursing Professionals.

* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  While 2221 is a very strong fit, if the role involved a greater degree of autonomy or specialized training beyond a typical registered nurse, one might consider:
    * **2240 - Paramedical Practitioners** (low probability, only if the role had unusual autonomy) 
    * **3221 - Nursing Associate Professionals** (low probability, only if the role was for a less qualified nurse assisting in the OR/ED) 
    * **3259 - Other Health Associate Professionals** (very low probability, only if the role was for a highly unusual, non-nursing health professional role in the OR/ED)

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**Step 1: Analyzing the Job Advertisement**

* **Job Title:** Consultant Cardiologist 
* **Description:** The advertisement emphasizes specialized knowledge in cardiology, including diagnosis, treatment, and potential surgical procedures. The role requires experience, qualifications like MRCP UK, and participation in an on-call rota. It also mentions influencing service design and promoting partnership working.

**Step 2: Comparing with Potential ISCO Units**

1. **ISCO 1342 (Health services managers):** While the role involves influencing service design, it's not the primary focus. The tasks and required qualifications don't align with a managerial position. 
2. **ISCO 2211 (Generalist medical practitioners):** This doesn't fit as the advertisement explicitly seeks a specialist in cardiology. 
3. **ISCO 2212 (Specialist medical practitioners):** This unit strongly aligns with the job description. The tasks, required qualifications (MRCP UK, CCT in Cardiology), and specialization focus all match.
4. **ISCO 2230 (Traditional and complementary medicine professionals):** This is not relevant as the advertisement focuses on modern medicine and cardiology.
5. **ISCO 2240 (Paramedical practitioners):**  The required qualifications and level of autonomy exceed those of a paramedical practitioner.
6. **ISCO 3221 (Nursing associate professionals):** This is not a match, as the role requires a medical doctor, not a nursing associate.
7. **ISCO 3230 (Traditional and complementary medicine associate professionals):**  Not relevant, as with ISCO 2230.
8. **ISCO 3256 (Medical assistants):**  The job requires significantly more expertise and autonomy than a medical assistant.
9. **ISCO 3259 (Health care assistants):**  This is not a match, as the role requires a medical doctor.
10. **ISCO 5321 (Health care assistants):** This is not a match, as the role requires a medical doctor.

**Step 3: Final Prediction**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2212
**ISCO Title:** Specialist medical practitioners
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly describes a specialist medical practitioner role focusing on cardiology. The required qualifications, tasks, and responsibilities align perfectly with the ISCO 2212 description. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A 

The provided ISCO units contained a highly relevant match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Job Ad ID: 809730118, Row: 25523, Pred: 7115, 7111, 7522, 9622, 7119, 7523, 7222, 9313, 7214, 7317
Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**

The job title is "Joiner," which directly matches the "Carpenter and Joiner" ISCO unit (7115). The description emphasizes traditional carpentry tasks like stud wall installation, roofing, door fitting, and skirting. 

**Step 2: Evaluate responsibilities and tasks.**

The job involves first and second fix carpentry work, aligning perfectly with tasks described in ISCO 7115, such as constructing frameworks, installing fixtures, and working with wood-based materials.

**Step 3: Assess required skills and qualifications.**

The ad explicitly requests a "skilled CSCS card," directly indicating a construction-related skillset.  Experience with specific carpentry tasks further reinforces the suitability of ISCO 7115.

**Step 4: Consider the ISCO structure.**

* **Major group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers):** This is a strong match, as the job requires hands-on construction skills.
* **Sub-major group 71 (Building and Related Trades Workers):**  Further confirms the relevance, narrowing it down to construction-specific trades.
* **Minor group 711 (Building Frame and Related Trades Workers):** This precisely aligns with the core tasks of a joiner.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 7115
* **ISCO Title:** Carpenters and Joiners 
* **Confidence:** 1.0 
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and the ISCO structure all strongly indicate that "Carpenters and Joiners" (7115) is the most appropriate classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  Not applicable in this case. The provided ISCO unit 7115 is a perfect match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

## Job Advertisement Analysis: Apotheker - aseptische Herstellung (m/w/d)

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation & Summary:**

* **Title:** Pharmacist - Aseptic Production (m/f/d)
* **Description:** The job involves overseeing the production of pain medications and other sterile and aseptic preparations. This includes quality management, acting as a contact person for clients and stakeholders, managing the raw material and finished product warehouse, overseeing GDP-compliant transport, and supporting production planning and personnel validation.

**2. Matching to Potential ISCO Units:**

* **2113 - Chemists:** While the job requires pharmaceutical knowledge, it focuses heavily on production, quality control, and regulatory compliance, not research and development which are the primary tasks of a Chemist. 
* **2230 - Traditional and Complementary Medicine Professionals:** This is not relevant. The job explicitly deals with aseptic production of conventional pharmaceuticals.
* **2262 - Pharmacists:** This is a strong match. The job title directly translates to "Pharmacist," and the description aligns with a pharmacist's expertise in medication preparation, quality assurance, and knowledge of regulations (ApBetrO). The responsibilities regarding client interaction and team support are also common in pharmacy practice.
* **3213 - Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants:**  While some tasks overlap (e.g., handling materials), the job requires a higher level of autonomy and decision-making than typically associated with a technician role. The advertisement emphasizes leadership and expertise in aseptic production, exceeding the scope of this unit.
* **3214 - Medical and Dental Prosthetic Technicians:** This is not relevant. The job focuses on pharmaceutical production, not medical or dental devices.
* **3230 - Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals:**  Not relevant, as explained for ISCO 2230.
* **3256 - Medical Assistants:** This is not a match. The job duties are specific to pharmaceutical production and do not align with the administrative and clinical support tasks of a medical assistant.
* **5329 - Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services:**  Not a match. This unit is too broad and encompasses roles with less specialized knowledge than required for aseptic pharmaceutical production.
* **7513 - Dairy Products Makers:**  Not relevant. This is unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry.
* **8131 - Chemical Products Plant and Machine Operators:** While the job involves overseeing production, the focus is on the pharmaceutical knowledge and regulatory aspects, not just machine operation. This unit lacks the required level of expertise in pharmaceutical regulations and quality management.

**3. Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2262
**ISCO Title:** Pharmacists
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, required qualifications (pharmacy degree, approbation), and responsibilities heavily involving aseptic production, quality management, and regulatory knowledge strongly indicate this as the most appropriate ISCO unit.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3213, 3133 (Chemical Processing Plant Controllers - not provided in the list but potentially relevant), 5329 

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

* While **3213 - Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants** is a less confident match due to the level of autonomy required, it could be considered if the job involves significant hands-on preparation under the guidance of a senior pharmacist.
* **3133 - Chemical Processing Plant Controllers** could be a potential alternative as they monitor and control chemical processes, which might be relevant to aseptic pharmaceutical production. However, this ISCO unit doesn't explicitly address the pharmaceutical knowledge and regulatory aspects crucial for this job.
* **5329 - Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services** is the least likely match due to its broad nature. It could only be considered if the role involves significantly more basic tasks than described in the advertisement.

## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **ISCO 1343 (Aged care services managers)**: This unit is not a good fit. While the ad mentions providing care for the elderly, it focuses on direct care tasks, not management responsibilities like directing staff, managing budgets, or developing policies. 

2. **ISCO 2635 (Social work and counselling professionals)**: This unit is also not suitable. The job description emphasizes physical care and assistance with daily living activities, not social work tasks like counselling, case management, or advocacy. 

3. **ISCO 3221 (Nursing associate professionals)**: This unit is a possibility. The ad mentions tasks like medication monitoring, which could fall under this category. However, the overall focus on companionship and basic care tasks suggests a less specialized role.

4. **ISCO 3412 (Social work associate professionals)**: This unit is not a good match. The job duties are more focused on direct personal care than on social work tasks like connecting clients with resources or implementing social assistance programs.

5. **ISCO 5152 (Domestic housekeepers)**: This unit is partially relevant. The job description includes tasks like house cleaning and meal preparation. However, the primary focus is on caregiving for the elderly, which goes beyond typical housekeeping duties.

6. **ISCO 5162 (Companions and valets)**: This unit is also partially relevant. The ad emphasizes companionship as a key responsibility. However, the job also involves a significant amount of personal care, which is not typical for companions or valets.

7. **ISCO 5311 (Child care workers)**: This unit is not relevant as the job specifically mentions caring for the elderly.

8. **ISCO 5321 (Health care assistants)**: This unit is a possibility. The job involves providing personal care in a home setting, which aligns with the description. However, the ad doesn't mention working under the supervision of health professionals, which is a key aspect of this unit.

9. **ISCO 5322 (Home-based personal care workers)**: **This unit appears to be the most appropriate match.** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for this unit, including providing personal care, assisting with daily living activities, and offering companionship in a home-based setting. 

10. **ISCO 5329 (Other personal care workers in health services)**: This unit is less specific and not the best fit as ISCO 5322 directly addresses the core responsibilities outlined in the ad.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5322
**ISCO Title:** Home-based personal care workers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement emphasizes providing personal care, assistance with daily living activities, and companionship to the elderly in their homes. This aligns strongly with the description of home-based personal care workers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3221, 5321, 5152

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Care Home General Manager" immediately suggests a management role within a health or social care setting. The description confirms this, focusing on responsibilities related to elderly care, resident well-being, and compliance with care standards.

2. **Evaluate potential ISCO units based on the provided order:**
    * **1219 - Business Services and Administration Managers:** While this unit covers general management functions, it lacks the specific focus on health and social care evident in the job ad. The required expertise in "elderly care," "safeguarding," and "CQC" are not reflected in this unit's description.
    * **1323 - Construction Managers:** This unit is entirely unrelated to the job ad, focusing on construction projects and not health care.
    * **1341 - Child Care Services Managers:** This unit is closer but still not a match. While it involves managing a care facility, the focus is on children, not the elderly. The required skills and knowledge for this role are significantly different.
    * **1342 - Health Services Managers:** This unit is a strong contender. It encompasses managing health care facilities, overseeing staff, ensuring compliance, and coordinating services – all relevant to the job ad. However, the description leans towards clinical settings like hospitals and clinics, not specifically residential care.
    * **1343 - Aged Care Services Managers:** This unit is the **most accurate match**. It directly aligns with the job title and description, focusing on managing residential and personal care for the elderly. The tasks listed, such as overseeing staff, managing budgets, coordinating services, and ensuring compliance, perfectly match the advertised role. 
    * **1344 - Social Welfare Managers:** This unit is related but broader than the specific requirements of the job ad. While it covers social and community services, it doesn't have the same focus on residential care for the elderly.
    * **1411 - Hotel Managers:** This unit is not a match. While it involves managing a facility with accommodation, the focus is on hospitality and tourism, not healthcare.
    * **1412 - Restaurant Managers:** This unit is entirely unrelated to the job ad, focusing on food service and not healthcare.
    * **1431 - Sports, Recreation and Cultural Centre Managers:** This unit is also unrelated, focusing on recreational facilities and not healthcare.
    * **5153 - Building Caretakers:** This unit is not a match. While it involves building maintenance, it lacks the managerial and healthcare aspects central to the job ad.

3. **Final determination:** Based on the analysis, ISCO unit **1343 - Aged Care Services Managers** is the most appropriate match for the "Care Home General Manager" job advertisement.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 1343
* **ISCO Title:** Aged Care Services Managers
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job description explicitly focuses on managing a residential care facility for the elderly, aligning perfectly with the scope of ISCO unit 1343. The required skills, responsibilities, and industry knowledge all fall under the purview of an Aged Care Services Manager.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1342, 1344, 1219

**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**

The job title is "Legal Counsel/Lawyer." This title is a strong indicator of a legal profession, aligning with the descriptions provided for ISCO unit **2611: Lawyers**. 

**Step 2: Evaluate the main responsibilities and tasks.**

The job advertisement lists tasks such as:

* Providing legal advice on real estate, commercial law, and civil law.

* Following up on real estate patrimony and corporate structure.
* Following up on regulatory issues and informing colleagues about new regulations.

These responsibilities heavily align with the tasks described for ISCO unit **2611: Lawyers**, particularly:

* "(a)  giving clients legal advice on a wide variety of subjects and undertaking legal business on clients’ behalf;"
* "(h)  negotiating settlements in matters which involve legal disputes;"
* "(j)  drawing up legal documents such as contracts, real estate transactions and wills and preparing statements of legal opinions."

**Step 3: Assess the required skills and qualifications.**

The job ad requires:

* Very good knowledge of real estate, commercial, and civil law.
* Practical experience in complex real estate transactions and investment processes.
* Minimum five years of experience in an independent position.
* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills.

These requirements match the high skill level (Skill Level 3 and 4) expected for professionals in ISCO unit **2611: Lawyers**.

**Step 4: Consider the major, sub-major, and minor groups.**

ISCO unit **2611: Lawyers** falls under:

* Major group 2: Professionals
* Sub-major group 26: Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals
* Minor group 261: Legal Professionals

This classification accurately reflects the professional nature of the job and its focus on legal expertise.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
* **ISCO Title:** Lawyers
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, responsibilities, required skills, and qualifications all strongly indicate that this position aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 2611: Lawyers.

## Job Advertisement Analysis: NAUCZYCIEL WYCHOWANIA PRZEDSZKOLNEGO (Preschool Teacher)

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO code:

**1. Translation & Initial Assessment:**

* The job title translates to "Preschool Teacher". 
* The description emphasizes leading activities and caring for children.
* This immediately points towards an occupation focused on early childhood education.

**2. Responsibilities & Tasks:**

* **"prowadzenie zajęć"** (conducting classes): This aligns with planning and leading educational activities for preschool children.
* **"opieka na dziećmi"** (caring for children): This encompasses the supervision, basic care, and social development guidance expected in a preschool setting.

**3. Skills & Qualifications:**

* **"wykształcenie wyższe (wychowanie przedszkolne)"** (higher education (preschool education)): This confirms the requirement of formal training in early childhood education, a key characteristic of professional educators.

**4. Matching to Potential ISCO Units:**

* **2342 - Early Childhood Educators:** This unit perfectly encapsulates the job description. 
    * **Job Title Match:** "Preschool teacher" is a direct match to the ISCO unit's examples.
    * **Task Match:**  Planning and organizing activities, promoting development, observing children, and communicating with parents are all explicitly mentioned in the ISCO description.
    * **Skill Match:** The required educational qualification aligns with the "high" skill level (3 & 4) of this unit.
    * **Major/Sub-major:** The classification under "Professionals" and "Teaching Professionals" is a strong indicator of accuracy.

**5. Alternative ISCO Units:**

Given the strong match with 2342, exploring alternatives is unnecessary. Other provided units either focus on different age groups (2341, 2352), management roles (1341), or specialized teaching areas (2353, 2354, 2359). None of them accurately reflect the core duties of a preschool teacher as described in the advertisement.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2342
* **ISCO Title:** Early Childhood Educators
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, required qualifications, and tasks strongly align with the definition and tasks outlined for Early Childhood Educators in ISCO unit 2342.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Beauty Therapist." This title is explicitly listed as a similar job title for ISCO unit **5142: Beauticians and related workers**. 

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists duties such as performing massages, facials, body wraps, manicures, and pedicures. These tasks align perfectly with the description of **ISCO unit 5142**. 

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** The job ad emphasizes strong communication skills, proactivity, and the ability to work independently and within a team. These skills are typical requirements for **Beauticians and related workers (5142)**. The required NVQ 3 in Beauty Therapy further strengthens the match with this ISCO unit.

4. **Analyze the major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO unit **5142** falls under:
    - Major group **5: Services and Sales Workers**
    - Sub-major group **51: Personal Services Workers** 

    This classification accurately reflects the nature of the job advertised, which involves providing personal care and beauty services directly to clients.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5142
**ISCO Title:** Beauticians and related workers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills, and industry all strongly indicate that this position aligns perfectly with the ISCO unit 5142: Beauticians and related workers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO code 5142 is a perfect match, so no alternative codes are needed.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the job advertisement:** The job ad for "Senior Graphic Designer (Forex)" emphasizes creating visual media for online products and services, websites, marketing materials, and trade shows. The role requires proficiency in design software (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign) and experience in the Forex industry.

2. **Comparing with ISCO unit 2163 (Product and garment designers):** While this unit involves design, it focuses on physical products and manufacturing processes. The required skills and industry context don't align with the job ad. Therefore, 2163 is not a suitable match.

3. **Comparing with ISCO unit 2166 (Graphic and multimedia designers):** This unit directly aligns with the job ad. It involves designing visual and audiovisual content for various media, including websites, animations, and print. The listed tasks like creating layouts, graphics, and working with clients match the job description. The required software skills are also directly mentioned. Therefore, **2166 is a strong match.**

4. **Considering other ISCO units:** Given the strong match with 2166, it's unnecessary to analyze the remaining units in detail. None of the other units encompass the core responsibilities of graphic design for online and offline media within a specific industry like Forex.

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2166
**ISCO Title:** Graphic and multimedia designers
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** This unit directly aligns with the job ad's emphasis on visual design for various media, including websites, marketing materials, and the use of relevant software. The Forex industry experience requirement further strengthens this categorization.
**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternatives needed.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2651 (Visual Artists):** While the job involves painting, it's not focused on creating original works of art. The job ad emphasizes practical application rather than artistic expression. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

2. **ISCO 3432 (Interior Designers and Decorators):** This unit is closer but still not a perfect fit. The job ad focuses on the practical application of painting and decorating, particularly in social housing projects, rather than the design aspect. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

3. **ISCO 7111 (House Builders):** This unit is too broad. While the job might involve working on houses, the primary responsibility is painting and decorating, not general house building. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

4. **ISCO 7115 (Carpenters and Joiners):**  The job ad mentions working alongside carpenters, but the advertised position is clearly distinct. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

5. **ISCO 7123 (Plasterers):**  The job ad doesn't mention plastering as a primary responsibility. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

6. **ISCO 7131 (Painters and Related Workers):** This unit aligns perfectly with the job title and description. The tasks described in the ad, such as preparing surfaces and applying paint, are core responsibilities of this ISCO unit. This ISCO unit is a strong match.

7. **ISCO 7132 (Spray Painters and Varnishers):** While there might be some overlap with spraying techniques, the job ad doesn't specifically require experience with spray painting equipment. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

8. **ISCO 7314 (Potters and Related Workers):** This unit is completely unrelated to the job ad. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

9. **ISCO 7316 (Signwriters, Decorative Painters, Engravers and Etchers):** This unit focuses on decorative arts and crafts, while the job ad emphasizes practical painting and decorating for buildings. This ISCO unit is a poor match.

10. **ISCO 9622 (Odd-job Persons):** While the job might involve some minor repairs, the primary focus is on professional painting and decorating, requiring specific skills and experience. This ISCO unit is a poor match.


## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7131
**ISCO Title:** Painters and Related Workers
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills (qualifications in painting and decorating), and tasks align strongly with the definition of "Painters and Related Workers" (ISCO 7131). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A 

The provided ISCO unit 7131 is a very strong match, and no alternative codes are necessary.

## ISCO Unit Analysis for UK Investing Reporter

**1. Analyzing the Top Potential ISCO Unit:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 1211**
* **ISCO Title:** Finance managers 

**Reasoning:** While this job involves finance, the reporter role doesn't align with the core tasks of a Finance Manager. The advertisement emphasizes journalistic skills like news judgment, writing, and source development, which are not central to a Finance Manager's responsibilities. 

**Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is not a good fit. Let's move to the next potential unit.

**2. Analyzing the Second Potential ISCO Unit:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 1346**
* **ISCO Title:** Financial and insurance services branch managers

**Reasoning:** Similar to the previous unit, this role focuses on managing financial services branches. The reporter position doesn't involve tasks like loan processing, customer service, or managing branch operations. 

**Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is also not a good fit. Let's proceed to the next one.

**3. Analyzing the Third Potential ISCO Unit:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 2412**
* **ISCO Title:** Financial and investment advisers

**Reasoning:** This unit is closer to the job ad's focus on investments but still doesn't match the core responsibilities. The reporter analyzes and reports on investment trends, while Financial and Investment Advisers develop financial plans and manage investments directly for clients.

**Conclusion:**  This ISCO unit is not the most accurate representation. Let's continue our analysis.

**4. Analyzing the Fourth Potential ISCO Unit:**

* **ISCO Code (unit code): 2413**
* **ISCO Title:** Financial analysts

**Reasoning:** This unit shows promise. Financial Analysts analyze financial information, monitor trends, and prepare reports, aligning with the reporter's tasks of analyzing investment trends, generating analysis, and writing stories. However, the reporter focuses specifically on the asset management industry, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the Financial Analyst description.

**Conclusion:** This ISCO unit is a potential match, but let's examine the remaining options to ensure it's the most accurate.

**5. Analyzing the Remaining Potential ISCO Units:**

The remaining ISCO units (Economists, Securities and finance dealers and brokers, Buyers, Trade brokers, Employment agents and contractors, and Real estate agents and property managers) are not relevant to the job advertisement. They focus on different industries and require distinct skill sets not reflected in the job description.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit): 2413**
* **ISCO Title:** Financial analysts
* **Confidence:** 0.8 
* **Reasoning:**  The reporter's responsibilities of analyzing investment trends, generating analysis, and writing stories closely align with the tasks of a Financial Analyst. The focus on asset management, while specific, falls under the broader umbrella of financial analysis.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2632 (Journalists), 2644 (Public Relations Professionals), 3512 (Authors, Journalists, and Related Writers)

**Reasoning for Alternatives:**

While 2413 is a strong match, these alternatives offer a potentially more specific fit:

* **2632 (Journalists):** This unit directly addresses the core function of the role – reporting on the investment industry.
* **2644 (Public Relations Professionals):**  The role might involve elements of shaping narratives around investment trends, aligning with some aspects of PR.
* **3512 (Authors, Journalists, and Related Writers):** This broader category encompasses the writing and reporting aspects of the job.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title:** "Senior Specialist Midwife, Drugs, Alcohol & Mental Health" 
    - The title clearly indicates a specialization within midwifery, focusing on substance use and mental health.
    - This suggests a higher level of expertise than a general midwife.

2. **Review the job description:**
    -  The description emphasizes providing care across the pregnancy continuum, including leading a continuity of care pathway.
    -  It mentions working within a team and providing care for women and families.
    -  The specialization in drugs, alcohol, and mental health is highlighted.

3. **Compare with ISCO descriptions:**
    - **2222 - Midwifery Professionals:** This unit best aligns with the job title and description. The tasks described in the ISCO unit, such as providing care and support before, during, and after childbirth, managing complications, and recognizing warning signs, are all relevant to the advertised role. 
    - **Other ISCO units:** The remaining units are less relevant. They either focus on general medical practice, other health professions, or social work, which don't align with the core responsibilities of a midwife.

4. **Consider the "Senior Specialist" aspect:**
    - The job title emphasizes a senior role, potentially involving leadership and training responsibilities. 
    - While ISCO 2222 doesn't explicitly mention senior roles, the specialized nature of the position and the requirement to lead a care pathway suggest a higher level of expertise and responsibility within this unit.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2222
**ISCO Title:** Midwifery Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for Midwifery Professionals. The "Senior Specialist" title indicates a high level of expertise and potential leadership responsibilities within this unit, even though the ISCO description doesn't explicitly mention such roles.

## ISCO Code Analysis: Sosiaalityöntekijän virka (Social Worker)

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided job advertisement and ISCO units:

**1. Job Title and Description Analysis:**

* **Translation:** The job title "Sosiaalityöntekijän virka" translates to "Social Worker Position". 
* **Description:** The description clearly outlines responsibilities related to child welfare and family services, including direct work with children, families, and collaborative entities. 
* **Keywords:**  "Social Worker", "Child Welfare", "Family Services", "Case Management", "Decision Making" strongly align with social work roles.

**2. Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* The advertisement emphasizes tasks like working directly with children and families, assessing situations, developing care plans, and making decisions regarding services – all core social work functions.

**3. Required Skills and Qualifications:**

* The requirement of being a "Laillistettu sosiaalityöntekijä" (Licensed Social Worker) is a strong indicator of a professional social work position. 
* The ad values collaboration, systemic thinking, and a commitment to professional development, aligning with social work values.

**4. Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:**

* **ISCO Code 2635 (Social work and counselling professionals)** demonstrates the strongest alignment:
    * **Major Group 2 (Professionals):**  The job requires a high level of education and specialized knowledge, fitting the "Professionals" category.
    * **Sub-major Group 26 (Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals):** The focus on social welfare and direct work with vulnerable populations aligns perfectly.
    * **Minor Group (Not specified in provided data, but implied):** The specific tasks and required qualifications clearly fall under social work within this sub-major group.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Eliminate irrelevant ISCO codes:** Codes like Child Care Service Managers (1341), Early Childhood Educators (2342), Sociologists (2632), Psychologists (2634), and Child Care Workers (5311) are quickly ruled out as they don't match the required qualifications or core job duties. 
2. **Close Examination:** ISCO Codes 1344 (Social Welfare Managers), 3353 (Government social benefits officials), and 3412 (Social work associate professionals) warrant closer examination. However:
    * **1344 (Social Welfare Managers):** While related to social work, this code focuses on management and administrative tasks, not direct service provision, which is central to the advertised position.
    * **3353 (Government social benefits officials):** This code focuses on determining eligibility for benefits, a component of the job, but not the primary focus.
    * **3412 (Social work associate professionals):** This code often involves assisting fully qualified social workers. The advertisement explicitly requires a licensed social worker, indicating a higher level of autonomy and responsibility.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 2635
* **ISCO Title:** Social work and counselling professionals
* **Confidence:** 1.0 
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, required qualifications, and tasks all strongly indicate a professional social work role within child and family services. ISCO Code 2635 accurately reflects this.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  3412, 1344, 3353 (in descending order of potential relevance, though significantly less likely than 2635)

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Waiter/Waitress". This directly matches the "Waiter" title listed under ISCO code 5131. 

2. **Main Responsibilities:** The job description emphasizes serving guests in various settings within the racecourse, including taking orders, serving food and beverages, and likely handling payments. These tasks align strongly with the description provided for ISCO code 5131: Waiters.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:**  While the advertisement doesn't explicitly list qualifications, it implies a need for good customer service skills, the ability to work under pressure ("extremely busy"), and potentially some knowledge of food and beverage service. These are typical requirements for Waiter/Waitress positions.

4. **Major/Sub-Major/Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO 5131 falls under Major Group 5: Services and Sales Workers, Sub-Major Group 51: Personal Service Workers. This aligns perfectly with the nature of the advertised position.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5131
**ISCO Title:** Waiters
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:**  The job title, description, and implied skills directly match the ISCO 5131 definition of "Waiters". The job's context within the service industry further strengthens this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided ISCO code (5131) is a perfect match, so no alternatives are needed.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2163 (Product and garment designers):** While the job involves design, it's clearly focused on graphic design for marketing, not product design. The tasks and skills listed don't align with this ISCO unit. 

2. **ISCO 2166 (Graphic and multimedia designers):** This is a strong match. The job title explicitly mentions "Graphic Designer," and the description emphasizes creating graphics for various marketing campaigns, aligning with the ISCO definition. The required skills like Photoshop, Illustrator, and HTML/CSS further support this classification.

3. **ISCO 2431 (Advertising and marketing professionals):**  While the designer will work closely with marketing, their primary role is creating visuals, not developing marketing strategies. The job description focuses more on design execution than market analysis or campaign planning.

4. **ISCO 2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals):**  The job mentions creating and maintaining web pages, and HTML/CSS skills are desired. However, the focus is on visual design within a pre-existing framework, not complex web development or programming. 

5. **ISCO 2651 (Visual artists):** This is too broad. While graphic design has artistic elements, this job is commercially focused on creating marketing materials, not fine art.

6. **ISCO 3118 (Draughtspersons):** This is not a match. Draughtspersons focus on technical drawings for engineering or architecture, not marketing graphics.

7. **ISCO 3431 (Photographers):** This is irrelevant to the job description, which focuses on digital graphic design, not photography.

8. **ISCO 3432 (Interior designers and decorators):** This is not relevant. The job is about designing digital and print graphics, not physical spaces.

9. **ISCO 7316 (Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers):** This is not a match. The job involves digital design, not hand-painted signs or decorative work.

10. **ISCO 7321 (Pre-press technicians):** While the designer's work will be used in printing, their role is creating the initial designs, not handling pre-press technicalities like plate-making or proofing. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2166
**ISCO Title:** Graphic and multimedia designers
**Confidence:** 0.95 
**Reasoning:**  The job title, description, required skills, and tasks strongly align with the definition of a Graphic and Multimedia Designer. The focus is on creating visual content for marketing campaigns across various media.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title & Description Analysis:** The job title is "Architect," and the description emphasizes designing buildings, preparing drawings, adhering to regulations, and overseeing projects. This strongly suggests ISCO 2161: Building architects.

2. **Responsibilities & Tasks:** The advertisement lists duties like providing predesign services (feasibility studies, site selection), preparing drawings and presentations, developing construction plans, and ensuring compliance with codes. These align perfectly with the tasks described for ISCO 2161.

3. **Skills & Qualifications:** The job requires an architecture degree, 5+ years of experience, proficiency in AutoCAD and 3D modeling, and strong communication skills. These are all typical requirements for Building architects (ISCO 2161).

4. **Major/Sub-major Groups:** ISCO 2161 falls under Major Group 2: Professionals, and Sub-major Group 21: Science and Engineering Professionals. This is a perfect fit for an architect role, which requires specialized knowledge and skills in building design and construction.

5. **Other ISCO Units:** While other units might share some similarities, none fit as accurately as 2161:
    - 1323 (Construction managers) focuses on project management and coordination, not the design aspects emphasized in the ad.
    - 2142 (Civil engineers) deals with broader infrastructure projects, while the ad is specific to buildings.
    - The remaining units are even less relevant, focusing on landscaping, urban planning, database administration, etc.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2161
**ISCO Title:** Building architects
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes an architect's role, aligning perfectly with the tasks, skills, and qualifications outlined for ISCO 2161: Building architects.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as 2161 is a very strong match.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Receptor," which is a synonym for "Hotel Receptionist." This immediately points towards ISCO unit **4224: Hotel Receptionists**.

2. **Main Responsibilities:** The job advertisement lists tasks such as:
    * Guest relations and communication
    * Room reservation management
    * Handling guest requests and complaints
    * Basic administration and inventory
    * Using software like Protel and MS Office

    These tasks strongly align with the description of **4224: Hotel Receptionists**.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement requires:
    * Tourism or related education
    * Language skills
    * Computer skills (MS Office, Protel)

    These requirements fit the skill level and typical qualifications for **4224: Hotel Receptionists**.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** 
    * **4224: Hotel Receptionists** falls under:
        * Major group 4: Clerical Support Workers
        * Sub-major group 42: Customer Services Clerks

    This categorization accurately reflects the nature of the job advertised.

5. **Eliminating Other ISCO Units:** While some tasks might seem related to other units, they are not the primary focus. For example:
    * **1411: Hotel Managers:** This requires a higher level of responsibility, including staff management and budgeting, which are not mentioned in the advertisement.
    * **2423: Personnel and Careers Professionals:** This involves recruitment, training, and HR policies, not guest-facing operational tasks.
    * **2431: Advertising and Marketing Professionals:** While the job involves social media and menu updates, these are presented as supporting tasks, not the core responsibility.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 4224
**ISCO Title:** Hotel Receptionists
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, responsibilities, required skills, and overall job description strongly indicate this is a Hotel Receptionist position.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  4221 (Travel consultants and clerks), 4226 (Client Information Workers), 5242 (Sales Demonstrators)

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Salaried GP". "GP" typically stands for "General Practitioner", a term explicitly mentioned in the most relevant ISCO unit (2211). This unit also lists "General practitioner" and "Practitioner, general" as examples. 

2. **Main Responsibilities:** The advertisement emphasizes patient care, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These align perfectly with the tasks described in ISCO unit 2211, such as conducting examinations, ordering tests, prescribing treatments, and providing health advice. 

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires a qualified GP with GMC registration (General Medical Council, UK), indicating a high level of medical expertise. This aligns with the requirement of a university-level medical degree and postgraduate training specified in ISCO unit 2211.

4. **Major/Sub-major Groups:** ISCO unit 2211 falls under Major Group 2 (Professionals) and Sub-major Group 22 (Health Professionals), which is a perfect fit for a General Practitioner role.

5. **Eliminating Other Options:**
    * **2212 (Specialist medical practitioners):** While GPs require extensive medical knowledge, they are not specialized in a specific area like those described in this unit.
    * **2230 (Traditional and complementary medicine professionals):** This unit focuses on alternative medicine practices, not conventional Western medicine practiced by a GP.
    * **2240 (Paramedical practitioners):** This unit describes practitioners with more limited scope than medical doctors, while GPs have full medical qualifications.
    * **2269 (Other health professionals):** This is a catch-all category for health professionals not fitting elsewhere. As the GP role clearly aligns with 2211, this is not suitable.
    * **3230 (Traditional and complementary medicine associate professionals):** Similar to 2230, this unit focuses on alternative medicine and a lower skill level than a GP.
    * **3253 (Community health workers):** This unit focuses on community health outreach and education, not direct patient care like a GP.
    * **3256 (Medical assistants):** Medical assistants work under the supervision of physicians, while GPs work independently.
    * **3259 (Medical secretaries):** This unit involves administrative and clerical tasks, not medical practice.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2211
**ISCO Title:** Generalist medical practitioners
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:**  The job advertisement explicitly describes a General Practitioner role, aligning perfectly with the definition, tasks, required skills, and qualifications of ISCO unit 2211.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are necessary as the match to 2211 is highly confident and accurate.

MAIN SELECTION CRITERIA: -qualification in the field -updated ISCIR authorization -professional experience WE OFFER: -employment contract concluded for an indefinite period -attractive salary -meal vouchers (granted from the first day of activity) -performance bonus -Easter and Christmas bonuses -medical services package (activated at the end of the probationary period) -work equipment Transportation can be provided from Brasov and from the areas: Zarnesti, Rasnov, Dumbravita. *The net salary offered includes meal vouchers. Further details will be provided during the interview.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Analyzing the job title and description:** The title clearly states "Forklift Operator." This directly corresponds to the "Lifting truck operator" described in **ISCO unit 8344**. 

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** Although the advertisement doesn't detail specific tasks, the role inherently involves operating a forklift to move and stack goods within a warehouse environment. This aligns with the tasks outlined in ISCO unit 8344.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The advertisement emphasizes the need for relevant qualifications and an updated ISCIR authorization. This implies specific training and licensing are mandatory for operating forklifts, further supporting the suitability of ISCO unit 8344.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO unit 8344 falls under:
    - Major group 8: Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
    - Sub-major group 83: Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators 
    
    This categorization accurately reflects the job's nature, involving operating machinery (forklift) within a plant/warehouse setting.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
**ISCO Title:** Lifting-truck operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title explicitly mentions "Forklift Operator," and the description, although brief, strongly suggests duties aligning with those of a Lifting-truck operator as defined in ISCO unit 8344. The required qualifications further solidify this classification.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Kitchen Assistant," which directly matches one of the similar job titles listed under ISCO code 9412: Kitchen Helpers. 

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:** The job advertisement emphasizes cleaning duties, maintaining utensils, assisting cooks and chefs, and ensuring hygiene standards. These tasks align strongly with the description provided for ISCO code 9412.

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires basic hygiene knowledge, understanding of detergent usage, familiarity with cleaning procedures, and fluency in Mandarin (likely for communication within the kitchen). These are all skills expected of a Kitchen Helper.

4. **Evaluate the major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO code 9412 falls under Major Group 9: Elementary Occupations, Sub-Major Group 94: Food Preparation Assistants. This categorization accurately reflects the supportive and practical nature of the advertised role.

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:** While some cleaning tasks might overlap with other ISCO units like 9111 (Domestic Cleaners) or 9112 (Cleaners and Helpers in offices, hotels...), the core responsibilities and the work environment clearly point to a kitchen-specific role.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 9412
**ISCO Title:** Kitchen Helpers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, required skills, and work environment strongly suggest this role aligns with the ISCO definition of Kitchen Helpers.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the job advertisement:** The job title is "KFC - General Manager." The description emphasizes responsibilities like leading a team, managing restaurant operations, ensuring customer satisfaction, meeting sales goals, and training staff. 

2. **Comparing with ISCO unit 110 (Commissioned armed forces officers):** This is immediately irrelevant. The job is in a civilian fast-food restaurant, not the armed forces.

3. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1120 (Managing directors and chief executives):** While the title "General Manager" might seem fitting here, the description focuses on operational day-to-day management of a single restaurant. This unit is more appropriate for those overseeing entire companies or large, diverse branches with multiple layers of management beneath them.

4. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1219 (Business services and administration managers):** This is a closer fit than the previous unit, but still not quite right. The focus here is on administrative services, facilities, and resource management, not the core functions of a restaurant like food service and customer interaction.

5. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1311 (Agricultural and forestry production managers):** This is entirely irrelevant, dealing with farming and forestry, not food service.

6. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1321 (Manufacturing managers):**  Again, irrelevant. This focuses on industrial production of goods, not restaurant operations.

7. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1322 (Mining managers):**  Completely irrelevant, focusing on resource extraction.

8. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1324 (Supply, distribution and related managers):** While logistics are involved in a restaurant, this is not the core focus. This unit is more suited for managing large-scale movement of goods, transportation systems, or warehousing.

9. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1411 (Hotel managers):** This is closer, but still not the best fit. While some responsibilities overlap (customer service, staff management), hotel management involves a broader range of services like accommodation, events, and often more complex logistics.

10. **Comparing with ISCO unit 1420 (Restaurant managers):** This is the **most appropriate ISCO unit**. The description directly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities listed: planning menus, managing staff, ensuring customer satisfaction, handling finances, and maintaining a clean and compliant establishment.

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1412
**ISCO Title:** Restaurant managers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly outlines the role of a restaurant general manager, aligning with the tasks, responsibilities, and skillset described in ISCO unit 1412.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1420, 1219, 1411

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "CSCS Plasterer" clearly indicates a plastering role. The acronym "CSCS" refers to the Construction Skills Certification Scheme, a UK-based certification body. This suggests the job requires a certain level of construction-related skill and safety awareness.

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The description is brief but mentions "Skimming, Making good & Finishing work". These terms are directly related to plastering tasks:
    - **Skimming:** Applying a thin layer of plaster to create a smooth surface.
    - **Making good:** Repairing damaged plasterwork.
    - **Finishing work:** Final touches on plasterwork, ensuring a polished look.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The ad explicitly requires a valid CSCS card, confirming the need for construction-related skills and safety knowledge common in the UK construction industry.

4. **Matching with ISCO Units:** Analyzing the provided ISCO units, we find:

    - **ISCO 7123 (Plasterers):** This unit perfectly matches the job title and description. The tasks listed within this unit, such as applying plaster, installing plasterboard, and creating decorative finishes, directly align with the advertised role.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Food Technology Teacher". This immediately points towards an educational role focused on a specific vocational subject. 
2. **Description Analysis:** The description emphasizes teaching "Food Technology" to high school students, implying a vocational focus on preparing students for careers in the food industry, not just general knowledge.
3. **Required Qualifications:** The advertisement requires a teaching qualification (PGCE or B.Ed. with QTS) specifically in "Food Technology or Hospitality/Catering/Food Science." This reinforces the vocational nature of the role.
4. **Responsibilities:** The role involves typical teaching duties like lesson planning, classroom management, and student assessment. However, the subject matter expertise in "Food Technology" remains the core focus. 
5. **ISCO Unit Comparison:**
    * **2320 - Vocational Education Teachers:** This unit perfectly aligns with the job advertisement. It explicitly includes teaching vocational subjects like "Food Technology" to prepare students for related careers. The required qualifications and responsibilities match the ISCO unit's description.
    * **Other ISCO Units:**  While other teaching units (2330, 2341) involve similar teaching duties, they lack the specific vocational focus on preparing students for employment in the food industry. The required qualifications in the advertisement further disqualify these options.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2320
**ISCO Title:** Vocational Education Teachers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a teaching role focused on the vocational subject of "Food Technology." The required qualifications and responsibilities align perfectly with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 2320: Vocational Education Teachers.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the job title and description:** The title "Junior Graphic Designer" immediately points towards ISCO units related to design.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The job description emphasizes creating visual materials like banners, logos, and designs using specialized software. This aligns strongly with the tasks described for ISCO code 2166, particularly tasks (d) and (e) which involve preparing visual materials and designing graphics and animation.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires proficiency in design software, understanding of marketing and website design, and a strong portfolio. These skills align with the description of ISCO code 2166, which highlights the use of digital tools and visual communication for various media, including websites and advertisements.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO code 2166 falls under the major group 2 (Professionals), sub-major group 21 (Science and Engineering Professionals). This fits the job ad as it requires specialized knowledge and skills in design software and visual communication principles.

## Final Prediction:

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Class 2 HIAB Driver" clearly indicates the operation of a heavy vehicle (Class 2) equipped with a HIAB (Hydraulic Arm Body) crane system. This points towards a role involving both driving and operating specialized machinery.

2. **Examine main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad emphasizes delivering goods using a Class 2 HIAB vehicle, indicating the primary tasks involve driving and operating the HIAB crane for loading/unloading. 

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires a minimum of 6 months of experience driving Class 2 HIAB vehicles, highlighting the need for specialized training and licensing. This further reinforces the dual nature of the role, demanding skills in both driving and crane operation.

4. **Analyze ISCO units based on relevance:**

    * **8332 - Heavy truck and lorry drivers:** While the job involves driving a heavy vehicle, the core responsibility extends beyond simply transporting goods. The HIAB operation for loading/unloading is a significant aspect not entirely covered by this ISCO unit.

    * **8322 - Car, taxi and van drivers:** This unit is not relevant as it focuses on smaller vehicles and doesn't encompass the operation of specialized machinery like a HIAB crane.

    * **8341 - Mobile farm and forestry plant operators:** This unit is not relevant as it pertains to operating machinery specific to agricultural and forestry settings, not construction or delivery.

    * **8342 - Earthmoving and related plant operators:** This unit focuses on operating machinery for excavation and groundworks, which doesn't align with the job's primary function of loading/unloading and transporting goods.

    * **8343 - Crane, hoist and related plant operators:** This unit comes closest to encompassing the job's requirements. It includes operating mobile cranes like the HIAB, aligning with the job's key tasks of lifting and moving goods.

    * **8344 - Lifting truck operators:** While the HIAB crane shares similarities with lifting trucks, this unit focuses on operating within warehouses and similar environments, not on public roads for deliveries.

    * **7215 - Riggers and cable splicers:** This unit is not relevant as it focuses on assembling rigging gear and installing cables, not operating cranes or driving vehicles.

    * **9331 - Hand and pedal vehicle drivers:** This unit is not relevant as it involves non-motorized vehicles and doesn't encompass the operation of heavy machinery.

    * **9332 - Drivers of animal-drawn vehicles and machinery:** This unit is not relevant as it involves animal-powered transportation, not modern vehicles or machinery.

    * **9333 - Freight handlers:** While the job involves handling freight, this unit focuses on manual tasks and doesn't encompass the operation of a HIAB crane or driving a heavy vehicle.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8343
**ISCO Title:** Crane, hoist and related plant operators
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Reasoning:** This job requires both driving a Class 2 vehicle and operating a HIAB crane, aligning strongly with the tasks and skills associated with crane and hoist operators. While the job primarily focuses on loading/unloading and delivery, the operation of the HIAB crane is integral to the role.

Response:
## ISCO Code Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2262
**ISCO Title:** Pharmacists
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** This job advertisement heavily emphasizes dispensing medication, advising customers on their use, and ensuring safety protocols are followed - all core tasks of a Pharmacist. The required qualifications (PSI registration) solidify this. While customer interaction is highlighted, it doesn't overshadow the core pharmaceutical duties.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3213, 2433, N/A

## Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2262 (Pharmacists):** This is a very strong match. The job title "Support Pharmacist" directly aligns with this ISCO unit. The description emphasizes tasks like dispensing prescriptions, advising on medication, and ensuring safety - all core responsibilities listed under 2262. The requirement of being PSI registered further confirms this. While the ad highlights customer interaction, it's within the context of a pharmacy setting and doesn't outweigh the core pharmaceutical duties.

2. **ISCO 3213 (Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants):** While some tasks overlap (e.g., dispensing medicines), this ISCO unit focuses on professionals working *under the guidance* of a pharmacist. The job ad implies a higher level of autonomy and decision-making, making 2262 a better fit.

3. **ISCO 2433 (Technical and Medical Sales Professionals):** This unit focuses on sales representatives for medical products. While customer interaction is important in the advertised role, it's not about selling but about providing pharmaceutical advice and services.

4. **Remaining ISCO Units:** The other units are even less relevant. They deal with traditional medicine, dental care, physiotherapy, religious work, IT support, or general health aides, none of which align with the job advertisement.

**Conclusion:** Based on the job title, required qualifications, and the emphasis on core pharmaceutical tasks, ISCO 2262 (Pharmacists) is the most appropriate classification with high confidence.  The focus on customer service doesn't negate the primary pharmaceutical responsibilities.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Senior Advertising Manager." The description emphasizes developing, producing, and launching advertising campaigns. This immediately points towards ISCO units related to advertising and marketing management.

2. **Review ISCO unit 1222 (Advertising and public relations managers):** This unit's definition and tasks heavily align with the job ad. Responsibilities like planning campaigns, managing budgets, coordinating with agencies, and overseeing staff are direct matches. The job title "Advertising manager" is also a direct match to the provided examples.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:** While other units like 2431 (Advertising and marketing professionals) and 2432 (Public relations professionals) touch upon advertising and marketing, they focus more on specialized tasks within those fields. The Senior Advertising Manager role in the ad requires a broader management approach, aligning better with 1222.

4. **Evaluate the level of responsibility:** The job ad explicitly mentions "Senior Advertising Manager," implying a high level of autonomy and decision-making. This aligns with the skill level 3 and 4 (high) associated with ISCO unit 1222, further confirming its suitability.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1222
**ISCO Title:** Advertising and public relations managers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job responsibilities, required experience, and seniority level strongly match the definition and tasks outlined for Advertising and public relations managers (ISCO 1222).

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Retail Security Officer". The description emphasizes security tasks like acting as a visual deterrent, patrolling, and ensuring safety. This immediately points towards security-related ISCO units.

2. **Evaluate ISCO unit 5414 (Security Guards):** This unit's description aligns perfectly with the job ad. The tasks listed (patrolling, controlling access, deterring theft) are all explicitly mentioned in the advertisement. The required skills like SIA badge, communication, and working under pressure all fall under the scope of a Security Guard.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:** While other units might share some similarities, none are as accurate as 5414. 
    - **5413 (Prison Guards):** Deals specifically with inmates in a prison environment, not relevant to a retail setting.
    - **5412 (Police Officers):**  Have broader law enforcement duties and powers beyond the scope of a retail security role.
    - **5153 (Building Caretakers):** While mentioning patrolling for security, their primary focus is building maintenance, not security.
    - **Other units:** The remaining units are even less relevant, focusing on armed forces, customs, stock keeping, or elementary tasks.

4. **Final assessment:** ISCO unit 5414 (Security Guards) comprehensively encompasses the responsibilities, required skills, and context described in the job advertisement. 

## Final prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5414
**ISCO Title:** Security Guards
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement directly aligns with the tasks, skills, and context described for Security Guards (ISCO 5414).

    * "HACCP training" - Directly relates to food safety, a key responsibility highlighted in the ISCO description for Chefs.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:**
    * "Chef de partie level required" - This signifies prior experience in a hierarchical kitchen structure, further supporting the "Chefs" classification.
    * The ad doesn't detail specific culinary skills, but the experience level implies their presence.

4. **Major/Sub-Major Groups:**
    * ISCO 3434 falls under Major group **3: Technicians and Associate Professionals**, fitting the skillset and knowledge required for a Sous Chef.

The provided ISCO units are all healthcare related, while the job advertisement is for a legal professional specializing in defendant clinical negligence. There is no direct match within the provided options. 

Here's why the provided ISCO units don't fit:

* **1342 (Health services managers):** This focuses on managing healthcare facilities, not legal defense.
* **2212 (Specialist medical practitioners):**  These are medical doctors, not legal professionals.
* **2221 (Nursing professionals):**  Again, a healthcare provider role, not legal.
* **2265 (Dieticians and nutritionists):**  No relation to legal work in the job ad.
* **3221 (Nursing associate professionals):**  Similar to nursing professionals, not a match.
* **3252 (Medical records and health information technicians):**  While dealing with medical information, this role doesn't involve legal defense.
* **3256 (Medical assistants):**  Direct patient care role, not legal.
* **3259 (Health associate professionals not elsewhere classified):**  Too broad, and the job ad is specific.
* **3344 (Medical secretaries):**  Administrative support, not legal work.
* **5321 (Health care assistants):**  Direct patient care, no legal aspect.

**Alternative ISCO Units (descending relevance):**

1. **2421 - Lawyers:** This is the most likely fit as it covers legal professionals who conduct research, advise, and represent clients in court. Clinical negligence falls under legal practice.
2. **2422 - Judges:** While not directly defending, judges preside over legal cases, and experience in clinical negligence would be relevant in a legal career path.
3. **1223 - Human Resources Professionals:**  A stretch, but large law firms have HR departments, and knowledge of clinical negligence could be useful in HR matters related to healthcare.

**Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):**  None of the provided units match.
**ISCO Title:** N/A
**Confidence:** 0 
**Reasoning:** The job ad is for a lawyer specializing in clinical negligence defense, which is not represented in the healthcare-focused ISCO units provided.
**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2421, 2422, 1223

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Translation and Summary:**

The job advertisement is in Bulgarian. Here is the translated version:

**Title:** CASHIERS FOR GAS STATION OMV Pernik
**Description:** OMV gas station in Dimova Mahala 6 district, is looking for employees to work at the cash register. The work is permanent and is on shifts - day and night /15-16 shifts per month for 12 hours/ on a fixed salary with an employment contract and insurance on the actual salary + food vouchers and additional bonuses over the advertised salary. The ad indicates the minimum gross salary received without the additional bonuses and food vouchers. To apply, please attach your CV and photo. The work is suitable for people with good communication skills, a desire to work with clients in a dynamic environment, and the ability to work in a team. Previous work experience is not required of the candidates. The work includes full company training, opportunity for development, developing teamwork skills, flexible working hours, and a motivation program.

**2. Analysis based on provided ISCO units:**

* **ISCO 3134 (Petroleum and natural gas refining plant operators):** This is not a match. The job involves cashier duties at a gas station, not operating refining equipment.
* **ISCO 4211 (Bank tellers and related clerks):** This is not a match. While handling cash is involved, the environment and tasks are different from a bank teller. 
* **ISCO 5230 (Cashiers and ticket clerks):** This is a strong match. The job description explicitly mentions "work at the cash register", handling payments, and similar tasks listed under this ISCO unit.
* **ISCO 5245 (Service station attendants):** This could be a partial match. While the ad doesn't mention fuel pumping duties, those are common at gas stations. However, the focus on cashier work makes ISCO 5230 a better fit.
* **ISCO 5246 (Food service counter attendants):** This is not a match. The job is at a gas station, not a food service establishment.
* **ISCO 8112 (Mineral and stone processing plant operators):** This is not a match. The job is unrelated to mineral or stone processing.
* **ISCO 8113 (Well drillers and borers and related workers):** This is not a match. The job is unrelated to drilling or boring.
* **ISCO 9334 (Shelf fillers):** This is not a match. The job doesn't involve stocking shelves in a retail environment.
* **ISCO 9510 (Street and related services workers):** This is not a match. The job is not providing services on the street.
* **ISCO 9623 (Meter readers and vending-machine collectors):** This is not a match. The job doesn't involve meter reading or vending machine duties.

**3. Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5230
**ISCO Title:** Cashiers and ticket clerks
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement clearly emphasizes working as a cashier at a gas station, handling payments, and using a cash register. These tasks align perfectly with the description of ISCO unit 5230. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 5245, 4211, 9334

**Reasoning for Alternatives:**

* **5245 (Service station attendants):**  While not explicitly stated, gas station cashiers often perform some service attendant duties.
* **4211 (Bank tellers and related clerks):**  There's some overlap in cash handling, but the gas station environment is less formal and requires different customer service skills.
* **9334 (Shelf fillers):**  Gas stations have retail sections, so some stocking might be involved, but it's unlikely to be the primary focus.

## Job Advertisement Analysis: Pracovník ostrahy - Valašské Meziříčí

Here's a breakdown of the job advertisement and its alignment with the provided ISCO units:

**1. Translation and Summary:**

* **Title:** Security Guard - Valašské Meziříčí
* **Description:** The advertisement seeks a security guard for a hobby market in Valašské Meziříčí. The position involves day and night shifts (12 hours) and offers a pay rate of 100 CZK/hour plus meal vouchers.  Responsibilities include CCTV monitoring and on-site security, with a focus on theft prevention ("záchyty"). Previous experience and immediate availability are required.

**2. ISCO Unit Analysis:**

* **5153 - Building Caretakers:** While this unit includes patrolling buildings for security, it focuses heavily on building maintenance and tenant management. This doesn't align with the advertised security guard role.

* **5413 - Prison Guards:** This unit is highly specific to correctional facilities and doesn't apply to a retail security guard position.

* **5414 - Security Guards:** This is the **most relevant** unit. The description of patrolling premises, controlling access, and preventing theft directly matches the advertised responsibilities. The job title "Security Guard" is also a direct match.

* **5419 - Other Protective Service Workers:** This unit encompasses a broader range of roles like lifeguards and animal control officers. While it includes security-related tasks, it's not as specific as 5414.

* **9214 - Garden and Horticultural Labourers:** This unit is entirely unrelated to the security guard position.

* **9334 - Shelf Fillers:** This unit focuses on stocking and organizing merchandise in retail settings and is not relevant.

* **9510 - Street and Related Services Workers:** This unit includes roles like car window washers and shoe shiners, which are not relevant.

* **9622 - Odd-job Persons:** This unit involves general maintenance and repair tasks, not security-related duties.

* **9623 - Meter Readers and Vending-Machine Collectors:** This unit is not relevant to the security guard position.

* **9629 - Other Elementary Workers:** This unit includes roles like cloakroom attendants and parking attendants, which are not a good fit.

**3. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 5414
* **ISCO Title:** Security Guards
* **Confidence:** 1.0 
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, and responsibilities strongly align with the tasks and definition of Security Guards (ISCO 5414).
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  No other provided ISCO unit is a suitable alternative.

Job Ad ID: 810711294, Row: 25487, Pred: 8122, 1321, 8160, 8183, 8131, 8171, 3133, 3122, 3139, 3135
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyzing ISCO 1321: Manufacturing Manager:** 
    - While the title "Coating Process Manager" suggests a management role, the job description focuses heavily on process optimization, quality control, and team training within the coating process itself. 
    - The tasks described in ISCO 1321 encompass broader responsibilities like budget management, acquisition of new plant equipment, and overall production strategy. These aspects are not mentioned in the job ad. 
    - Therefore, ISCO 1321 is too broad and encompasses responsibilities beyond the scope of this specific role.

2. **Analyzing ISCO 3122: Manufacturing Supervisor:**
    - This unit aligns better with the job ad. The focus on coordinating and supervising activities within the coating process, ensuring worker safety, and providing training aligns with the described responsibilities.
    - The job ad mentions "leading a team" and "managing, coaching, and mentoring," which are core aspects of a supervisory role.

3. **Analyzing remaining ISCO units:**
    - The remaining ISCO units (3133, 3135, 3139, 8122, 8131, 8160, 8183) focus on specific technical operations and machine operation within various industries. 
    - The job ad emphasizes leadership, continuous improvement, and training, indicating a role beyond hands-on operation. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3122
**ISCO Title:** Manufacturing Supervisor
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement emphasizes leading a team, driving continuous improvement in the coating process, and ensuring quality and efficiency. These responsibilities align strongly with the tasks and definition of a Manufacturing Supervisor.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1321, 3139, 8122

Job Ad ID: 740759833, Row: 25486, Pred: 1330, 3511, 3155, 3522, 3512, 1120, 1223, 2434, 3513, 3114
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title:** "Chief Technology Officer (CTO)" 
    * This title is frequently listed as a "similar job title" for **ISCO Code 1330: Information and communications technology services managers**. 

2. **Review the job description:** The description emphasizes:
    * Defining overarching technology strategy aligned with business objectives.
    * Promoting innovation across research, development, and technology implementation.
    * Overseeing Business Development and Engineering departments for timely product development.
    * Ensuring technology standards and best practices are met.
    * Analyzing industry trends and representing the company in external settings.

3. **Compare responsibilities to ISCO 1330:** The CTO role aligns strongly with the tasks outlined for ICT services managers, particularly:
    * Formulating and directing ICT strategies.
    * Directing the selection and installation of ICT resources.
    * Overseeing the security of ICT systems.
    * Evaluating technology use and recommending improvements.
    * Representing the organization at ICT-related events.

4. **Consider required skills and qualifications:**
    * The job ad stresses strategic thinking, leadership, communication, and financial acumen.
    * These skills align with the "Managers, professionals, and technicians" skill group and the high skill level (3 and 4) associated with ISCO 1330.

5. **Evaluate major, sub-major, and minor groups:**
    * **Major group 1: Managers** is a perfect fit, as the CTO role is inherently managerial.
    * **Sub-major group 13: Production and Specialized Services Managers** aligns well, as technology is a specialized service area.

6. **Compare to other potential ISCO units:** While other units share some similarities, none encompass the full scope of the CTO role as comprehensively as ISCO 1330. 
    * **ISCO 1120 (Managing directors and chief executives)** is too broad. While the CTO reports to the highest levels, their focus is on technology, not overall organizational management.
    * **ISCO 1223 (Research and development managers)** is too narrow.  The CTO oversees R&D but also encompasses broader technology strategy, implementation, and operations.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1330
**ISCO Title:** Information and communications technology services managers
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The CTO role's responsibilities, required skills, and position within the organization align strongly with the definition and tasks outlined for ICT services managers. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 1120, 1223, 2434

Response:
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and potential ISCO units:

**Step 1: Translation and Initial Assessment**

* **Job Advertisement Translation:**
    * Title: Production Worker
    * Description: Production worker We are looking for a production worker for our client Loimaa. The work starts as a fixed-term contract of about six months, but if you do well...

* **Initial Observations:** The job title "Production Worker" and the limited description suggest a general manufacturing or industrial role. The advertisement lacks specific details about tasks and responsibilities.

**Step 2: Analyzing Potential ISCO Units**

We analyze the ISCO units in the order they were provided, keeping in mind the general nature of the job advertisement.

* **6121: Livestock and Dairy Producers:** This unit is immediately irrelevant. The advertisement makes no mention of agriculture, livestock, or dairy.

* **6122: Poultry Producers:**  Similarly, this unit is irrelevant as it focuses on poultry farming.

* **7513: Dairy Products Makers:** This unit is also irrelevant. It focuses on the specific craft of making dairy products, while the advertisement suggests a broader production role.

* **8131: Chemical Products Plant and Machine Operators:** This unit is potentially relevant. It involves operating machinery in a production setting, which aligns with the "Production Worker" title. However, the lack of information about chemical processing in the advertisement makes it difficult to be certain.

* **8142: Plastic Products Machine Operators:** This unit is also potentially relevant for the same reasons as 8131. It involves machine operation in a specific manufacturing sector. Again, the lack of details in the advertisement makes it difficult to confirm its suitability.

* **8155: Fur and Leather Preparing Machine Operators:** This unit is less relevant. It focuses on a specialized area of leather and fur processing, which is unlikely to be what a general "Production Worker" advertisement targets.

* **8160: Food and Related Products Machine Operators:** This unit is potentially relevant. It covers a wide range of food and beverage production roles involving machine operation, making it a plausible match for the advertisement.

* **9211: Crop Farm Labourers:** This unit is irrelevant, focusing on agricultural labor, not industrial production.

* **9212: Livestock Farm Labourers:**  This unit is also irrelevant, dealing with livestock care, not production work.

* **9213: Mixed Crop and Livestock Farm Labourers:** This unit is irrelevant for the same reasons as the previous two.

**Step 3: Reasoning and Conclusion**

Based on the analysis:

* The job advertisement is too vague to confidently assign a specific ISCO code. 
* The most likely scenarios, given the "Production Worker" title, are that the role involves machine operation in a factory setting. 

**ISCO Code (unit): 8100**
**ISCO Title: Stationary Plant and Machine Operators**
**Confidence: 0.5**
**Reasoning:**  Due to the lack of information, a broader ISCO category that encompasses various machine operator roles is the most appropriate. This provides a general classification without making assumptions about the specific industry.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 8131, 8142, 8160**

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

* **8131 (Chemical Products Plant and Machine Operators), 8142 (Plastic Products Machine Operators), and 8160 (Food and Related Products Machine Operators)** are listed as alternatives because they represent the most common types of production work involving machine operation. However, without more information from the job advertisement, it is impossible to determine which specific industry is most likely.

## ISCO Unit Analysis for "Vedúci oddelenia"

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the most appropriate ISCO unit:

**1. Job Title and Description Analysis:**

* **Title:** "Vedúci oddelenia" translates to "Department Manager". This title aligns strongly with managerial roles within retail environments.
* **Description:** The description emphasizes responsibilities like ensuring smooth operation, managing staff, optimizing product flow, and monitoring key performance indicators. These are all core duties of retail management.

**2. Responsibilities and Tasks:**

* The advertisement lists tasks such as:
    * Ensuring optimal product flow and availability.
    * Leading, supporting, and motivating a team.
    * Planning staff schedules.
    * Monitoring sales and implementing improvement measures.
* These tasks closely match the description of **ISCO 1420: Retail and Wholesale Trade Managers**.

**3. Required Skills and Qualifications:**

* The advertisement requires:
    * Completed secondary education.
    * Experience in leadership and team motivation.
    * Experience in retail and with fresh produce.
    * Customer and results-oriented approach.
    * Basic MS Office skills.
    * Organizational skills and adaptability.
* These requirements align with the skill level and typical qualifications for **ISCO 1420**.

**4. Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**

* **ISCO 1420** falls under:
    * Major Group 1: Managers 
    * Sub-major Group 14: Hospitality, Retail and Other Services Managers
* This categorization is a perfect match for the advertised position, which involves managing a department within the retail sector.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the analysis of the job title, description, responsibilities, required skills, and ISCO categorization, the advertisement strongly indicates a managerial role within a retail environment. The listed tasks and required qualifications align perfectly with the definition and typical duties of a retail department manager.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 1420
* **ISCO Title:** Retail and Wholesale Trade Managers
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a retail department manager role, aligning perfectly with the responsibilities, required skills, and ISCO categorization of unit 1420. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  Not applicable in this case. The provided ISCO unit 1420 is a very strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
## ISCO Unit Determination Reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Phlebotomist-Phlebotomy-B2". This directly matches the "Phlebotomist" title listed as an example under ISCO unit **5329: Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services**. 

2. **Main Responsibilities:** The job description emphasizes:
    * Venepuncture service for patients.
    * Working within a team.
    * Ensuring timely delivery of blood specimens.
    * Good communication and initiative.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** While specific qualifications aren't stated, the ad implies the need for:
    * Phlebotomy certification (likely due to "band 2" designation).
    * Practical skills in venepuncture.
    * Teamwork and communication skills.

4. **ISCO Unit Alignment:**
    * **5329 (Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services):** This unit's description of "routine health and personal care support" aligns well with a phlebotomist's tasks. The focus on direct patient interaction, but under the supervision of other health professionals, is a key match.
    * **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining units are less relevant:
        * They focus on laboratory analysis (**3212**), nursing care (**3221**), medical records (**3252**), or specialized roles (**2240, 3256, 3259, 4229, 4416, 5321**). None encompass the core tasks of a phlebotomist.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5329
**ISCO Title:** Other Personal Care Workers in Health Services
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, responsibilities, and implied skills strongly indicate a phlebotomist role, which directly falls under ISCO unit 5329.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** N/A - No suitable alternatives from the provided list.

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Job Title & Description Analysis:** The job title is "Social Worker - Safeguarding Team". This directly aligns with the description and similar job titles provided in **ISCO Code 2635: Social work and counselling professionals**. 

2. **Responsibilities & Tasks:** The job ad mentions "CP & CIN cases which will be carried through to proceedings". This refers to Child Protection and Child In Need cases, indicating work with vulnerable families and children, a core responsibility of social workers (as described in 2635).

3. **Skills & Qualifications:** While the ad doesn't list specific skills, it requires "experienced Social Workers". This implies a high level of skill (level 3 or 4) in social work, aligning with the skill level of ISCO 2635.

4. **Major/Sub-Major/Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO 2635 falls under:
    - **Major Group 2: Professionals** - This fits as social work requires specialized knowledge and ethical conduct.
    - **Sub-Major Group 26: Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals** -  Accurately reflects the job's focus.

5. **Eliminating Other Options:**
    - **Other ISCO codes** provided primarily focus on management (Major Group 1) or associate professional roles (Major Group 3), which don't match the required experience level or job title.
    - **ISCO 3412: Social work associate professionals** is closer but implies a less experienced role, unlike the "experienced Social Workers" sought.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2635
**ISCO Title:** Social work and counselling professionals
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:**  The job title, description, focus on child safeguarding, and requirement for experienced workers strongly indicate this is a social work role aligning with ISCO 2635.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 3412, 1344, 3353

Job Ad ID: 717718927, Row: 25481, Pred: 2611, 3411, 3342, 2619, 2423, 2635, 2412, 3353, 3412, 4229
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Private Client Solicitor."  The description emphasizes providing legal advice on private client matters like wills, estates, and trusts.  This strongly suggests a legal professional focused on civil law, not financial advising or social work.

2. **Compare to provided ISCO units:**
    * **2412 (Financial and investment advisers):** This is immediately irrelevant. The job involves legal expertise, not financial planning.
    * **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):**  Also irrelevant. The focus is not on HR or recruitment.
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This appears highly relevant. The job description aligns with the tasks of lawyers: giving legal advice, drafting legal documents (wills, trusts), and potentially representing clients in court (contentious probate).
    * **2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** While this could technically encompass a solicitor, 2611 (Lawyers) is a more specific and accurate fit. 
    * **2635 (Social work and counselling professionals):**  Not relevant. The job deals with legal matters, not social or personal issues.
    * **Remaining ISCO codes (3342, 3353, 3411, 3412, 4229):** These all relate to support roles within legal or social work fields. The job advertisement clearly seeks a qualified solicitor, not a paralegal or assistant.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad implies the need for a qualified solicitor (being "widely renowned" firm and seeking someone to join a "highly successful team" suggests experience).  This further supports the classification as a lawyer.

4. **Major/Sub-major/Minor groups:**  The most relevant ISCO unit, 2611 (Lawyers), falls under:
    * Major: 2 (Professionals) - Accurate, as the role requires high expertise.
    * Sub-major: 26 (Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals) -  Again accurate, reflecting the legal nature of the work.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
**ISCO Title:** Lawyers
**Confidence:** 1.0 
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes a solicitor role, focusing on providing legal advice and services to private clients on matters like wills, estates, and trusts. This aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks of ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers).

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The provided 2611 is a precise fit, making alternatives unnecessary.

    - **Major group 5:** Services and Sales Workers
    - **Sub-major group 52:** Sales Workers

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 5241
**ISCO Title:** Fashion and other models

    * Request necessary information from state institutions, municipal administration, as well as individuals and legal entities, to prepare a comprehensive assessment of the need for social services.
    * Advise citizens on opportunities to use social services in the community or specialized institutions.
* **Contract Type:** Permanent
* **Working Hours:** Full-time (8 hours/day)
* **Salary:** 876 BGN 
* **Vacancies:** 1
* **Experience:** Not specified
* **Language Skills:** Not specified
* **Computer Skills:** Required
* **Driving License:** Not specified

## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the Job Title and Description:** The job title "Social Worker, People with Disabilities and Social Services" immediately points towards a role focused on social work, particularly assisting individuals with disabilities. This aligns strongly with the description, which emphasizes tasks like needs assessment, providing support, and connecting individuals with resources.

2. **Matching with Potential ISCO Units:**

    * **ISCO 2635 (Social work and counselling professionals):** This unit is the **most relevant** based on the job title and description. The tasks listed in the ISCO description, such as interviewing clients, assessing situations, providing counseling, planning assistance programs, and advocating for client groups, directly correspond with the advertised responsibilities. 

3. **Considering Skills and Qualifications:** While the advertisement doesn't specify experience or language requirements, it mentions computer skills as necessary. This aligns with the general expectation for social work professionals to utilize technology for communication, documentation, and research.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO 2635 falls under Major Group 2 (Professionals), Sub-major Group 26 (Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals). This categorization accurately reflects the professional nature of social work and its focus on social well-being.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2635

**ISCO Title:** Social work and counselling professionals

**Confidence:** 0.9

**Reasoning:** The job title, description, and required skills strongly indicate a social work role focused on assisting individuals with disabilities. ISCO 2635 aligns perfectly with these aspects, encompassing all the core responsibilities and tasks outlined in the advertisement.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  While 2635 is a strong match, here are three potential alternatives in descending order of relevance:

* **3412 (Social work associate professionals):** If the position involves a greater emphasis on implementing programs under the guidance of a higher-level social worker, this code could be a possibility.
* **3353 (Government social benefits officials):**  This option becomes relevant if the role involves a significant focus on determining eligibility for government benefits and financial assistance programs. 
* **4229 (Client information workers not elsewhere classified):** This is less likely but could be considered if the primary responsibility involves gathering and processing client information for service eligibility.

* **Major/Sub-major/Minor Groups:** The job clearly falls under Health Professionals (Major Group 2, Sub-major Group 22).

**3. Matching with Provided ISCO Units:**

* **ISCO 2212 (Specialist medical practitioners):** While working in an eye clinic, the job description doesn't indicate the need for a medical doctor's qualifications. This ISCO unit is too high a skill level.
* **ISCO 2240 (Paramedical practitioners):**  Similar to the above, the job description doesn't suggest the Orthoptist would be performing advanced medical procedures.
* **ISCO 2240 (Audiologists and speech therapists):** This unit focuses on hearing and speech, not vision.
* **ISCO 2266 (Optometrists and ophthalmic opticians):** This unit's description explicitly lists "Orthoptist" as an example occupation and aligns perfectly with the job ad's focus on eye care and examinations. 

**4. Final Prediction:**

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Mismatch:** The job title is "Carpenter," but the description clearly states they are looking for a "Plumber." This indicates a likely error in the job advertisement.

2. **Focus on Job Description:** Given the error, we will prioritize the job description. The ad focuses on "reactive repairs within tenanted domestic properties" and lists tasks related to plumbing: 
    - Social Housing Repairs experience.
    - NVQ level 2 or equivalent in Plumbing.

3. **Matching with ISCO units:** Analyzing the provided ISCO units, we find a strong match with:
    - **ISCO Code (unit code): 7126**
    - **ISCO Title: Plumbers and pipe fitters**

4. **Rationale for the Match:** This ISCO unit aligns perfectly with the job description:
    - **Job Definition:**  Focuses on assembling, installing, repairing, and maintaining pipe systems, drains, and related fixtures for water, gas, drainage, and sewerage systems.
    - **Tasks:** Include inspecting, examining, and testing installed systems and pipes, aligning with "reactive repairs."
    - **Examples of Occupations:** Explicitly lists "Plumber" and "Drain technician."

5. **Confidence:** Considering the clear match between the job description and ISCO unit 7126, we have high confidence in this classification.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7126
**ISCO Title:** Plumbers and pipe fitters
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** Despite the job title error, the description clearly focuses on plumbing tasks and requirements, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks of ISCO unit 7126.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The primary prediction has a high confidence level, and no other provided ISCO unit comes close in relevance.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Clinical Negligence Locum/Consultant". This indicates a legal role focusing on clinical negligence cases. The description confirms this, highlighting responsibilities like managing claims, litigation, drafting legal documents, and representing clients in court. This immediately points away from the provided ISCO units, which are heavily focused on healthcare practitioners and managers.

2. **Evaluate main responsibilities and tasks:** The core tasks revolve around legal expertise: advising on claims, litigation, drafting documents, and representing clients. These are not reflected in the provided ISCO unit descriptions.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires a "qualified solicitor" with experience in clinical negligence. This signifies a legal professional, further distancing the job from the provided ISCO units.

4. **Analyze major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The provided ISCO units fall under "Managers" (1), "Professionals" (2), "Technicians and Associate Professionals" (3), and "Clerical Support Workers" (4).  The job ad clearly aligns with "Professionals," but the specific sub-major groups provided (healthcare, business administration) are not relevant.

## Conclusion:

The provided ISCO units are not suitable for this job advertisement. They primarily describe healthcare roles, while the ad seeks a legal professional specializing in clinical negligence.

## Alternative ISCO units:

Based on the analysis, here are three potentially more appropriate ISCO units:

1. **2611 - Legal professionals:** This unit encompasses professionals providing legal advice and services, aligning with the job ad's description.
2. **2424 - Business and administration professionals:** While not a perfect fit, this unit includes professionals specializing in specific business areas, potentially encompassing legal consulting within a business context.
3. **3339 - Other business and administration associate professionals:** This broader category could include legal support roles, although it may not fully capture the seniority and expertise required.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):**  None of the provided units are suitable.
**ISCO Title:** N/A
**Confidence:** 0
**Reasoning:** The job ad describes a legal professional specializing in clinical negligence, which is not reflected in the provided healthcare-centric ISCO units.
**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2611, 2424, 3339

Job Ad ID: 843358332, Row: 25475, Pred: 2354, 2341, 2355, 2352, 2359, 2353, 2330, 5312, 2652, 7312
Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title translates to "Teacher with Danish, Music, Home Economics, and Physical Education for Skanderborg Realskole". This immediately suggests a teaching profession within a school setting.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job advertisement lists responsibilities related to teaching Danish, Music, Home Economics, and Physical Education across different grade levels. This indicates a multi-subject teaching role, common in primary or secondary education. 

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The ad requires a Danish teaching qualification and applicable competencies in the mentioned subjects. This confirms the requirement of formal teaching qualifications.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** The provided ISCO units fall under Major Group 2: Professionals, specifically Sub-major Group 23: Teaching Professionals. This aligns with our analysis so far.

5. **Analyzing Potential ISCO Units:**

    * **2330 - Secondary Education Teachers:** While the school teaches grades 1-9, the ad emphasizes teaching a 4th-grade class and having permanent roles in Music and Home Economics, subjects often more prominent in primary education. This unit might not be the best fit.

    * **2341 - Primary School Teachers:** This unit aligns well with the multi-subject teaching across various grades, including a homeroom role in 4th grade. The focus on Music and Home Economics further strengthens this possibility.

    * **2352 - Special Needs Teachers:** The advertisement does not mention any focus on special needs education. This unit is not relevant.

    * **2353 - Other Language Teachers:** The ad focuses on teaching Danish as a primary subject, not as a foreign or second language. This unit is not a match.

    * **2354 - Other Music Teachers:** While Music is a significant part of the role, it's not the sole focus. The teacher is expected to teach other subjects within the regular school curriculum, making this unit less suitable.

    * **2355 - Other Teaching Professionals:** This unit encompasses various teaching roles outside mainstream education. As the ad clearly positions the role within a school, this unit is not the best fit.

    * **2652 - Musicians, Singers and Composers:** This unit focuses on musical performance and composition, not teaching. It's not relevant to the job ad.

    * **5312 - Teachers' Aides:** This unit represents a supporting role to teachers, not a qualified teaching position. It's clearly not a match.

    * **7312 - Musical Instrument Makers and Tuners:** This unit involves crafting and repairing instruments, not teaching. It's entirely unrelated to the job ad.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit): 2341**
**ISCO Title: Primary School Teachers**
**Confidence: 0.8**
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement strongly suggests a primary school teaching position due to the multi-subject teaching responsibilities, including core subjects like Danish and Music, alongside Home Economics and Physical Education. The emphasis on a 4th-grade homeroom role further supports this classification.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 2330, 2359, 2354** 

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **2330 (Secondary Education Teachers):**  While less likely, the school's structure covering grades 1-9 leaves a slight possibility that the role might be classified as secondary depending on the specific grade level divisions within the Danish system. 
* **2359 (Other Teaching Professionals):** This is a very distant alternative, only applicable if the Danish school system significantly deviates from standard primary/secondary models.
* **2354 (Other Music Teachers):** This is even less likely than 2330 and 2359, only applicable if the school considers the music teaching aspect as a separate, specialized role outside the core curriculum.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title & Description Analysis:** The job title "ODGOJITELJ/ICA" translates to "Teacher" or "Educator". The description emphasizes creating a positive learning environment for children, developing their skills, and interacting with parents. This aligns strongly with the roles of early childhood educators and pre-school teachers.

2. **Responsibilities & Tasks:** The advertisement lists responsibilities like implementing educational programs, maintaining discipline, observing children's progress, and communicating with parents. These tasks are central to the roles of both ISCO 2341 (Primary School Teachers) and 2342 (Early Childhood Educators).

3. **Required Skills & Qualifications:** The job requires a university-level degree in a relevant field, suggesting a higher level of education than a typical childcare worker. This aligns with the skill level 3 requirement of both ISCO 2341 and 2342.

4. **Major/Sub-major Groups:** Both ISCO 2341 and 2342 fall under Major Group 2 (Professionals) and Sub-major Group 23 (Teaching Professionals), which is a perfect match for the job description.

5. **Key Difference:** The advertisement specifies the role is within a "Dječji vrtić" which translates to "Kindergarten" or "Preschool". This is a crucial distinction as it points towards children below primary school age, making ISCO 2342 (Early Childhood Educators) a more accurate fit.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2342
**ISCO Title:** Early Childhood Educators
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:**  The job advertisement strongly aligns with the tasks, required education, and environment of an Early Childhood Educator. The focus on pre-primary education in a kindergarten setting makes this ISCO code the most appropriate.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "SAP Application Developer". This immediately points towards a role focused on software development within the SAP ecosystem. This aligns strongly with the ISCO Major group **2: Professionals** and Sub-major group **25: Information and Communications Technology Professionals**.

2. **Examine responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists responsibilities like deriving specifications, coding, unit testing, documenting code, and working with application consultants. These tasks are core software development activities.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad emphasizes ABAP (SAP's programming language), EWM (Extended Warehouse Management), RFUI (Radio Frequency User Interface), S4 (SAP Business Suite 4), and WM (Warehouse Management). These are all highly specialized skills within the SAP domain.

4. **Match with potential ISCO units:**

    * **2424 (Training and staff development professionals):** This is immediately irrelevant. The job has nothing to do with training or development.

    * **2433 (Technical and medical sales professionals):**  Also irrelevant. This job focuses on selling, while the ad is about software development.

    * **2511 (Systems analysts):** While there might be some overlap in analysis tasks, this job is more about implementing existing systems, not developing new software like an SAP Application Developer.

    * **2512 (Software developers):**  This is a strong match. The job title, description, tasks, and required skills align perfectly with the definition of a software developer. 

    * **2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals):** This is less relevant. While web technologies might be tangentially involved, the core focus on ABAP and SAP modules makes this a less accurate fit than 2512.

    * **2514 (Applications programmers):**  This is also a possible match. The tasks of writing and maintaining code align with this description. However, the emphasis on SAP-specific skills and working with consultants suggests a broader role than just programming.

    * **2519 (Software and applications developers and analysts not elsewhere classified):** This is a catch-all category and could technically fit. However, 2512 (Software developers) is a more precise and accurate match.

    * **2522 (Systems administrators):**  This is not a good match. The focus here is on maintaining existing systems, not developing new applications within the SAP environment.

    * **3333 (Employment agents and contractors):** Completely irrelevant. This job is about recruitment, not software development.

    * **3412 (Social work associate professionals):**  Also irrelevant, with no connection to the advertised role.

5. **Final decision:** Based on the analysis, the most appropriate ISCO unit is **2512 (Software developers)**. While 2514 (Applications programmers) is also somewhat relevant, the job ad points towards a more senior role with a broader scope than just coding.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2512
**ISCO Title:** Software developers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, required skills (ABAP, EWM, RFUI), and tasks (coding, unit testing, working with consultants) all strongly indicate a software development role within the SAP ecosystem, aligning perfectly with the ISCO 2512 definition.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2514, 2519, 2511

Response:
**Step 1: Analyze the job title and description.**

The job title is "Restaurant Manager." This title directly matches the "Restaurant manager" example listed in ISCO unit 1412: Restaurant managers. 

**Step 2: Analyze the main responsibilities and tasks.**

The job advertisement lists the following responsibilities:

* Manage every aspect of the restaurant's organization.
* Manage the team and set an example of professionalism.
* Create a welcoming atmosphere for customers.
* Manage the team to create a family environment.

These responsibilities align with the tasks described in ISCO unit 1412, such as:

* Planning and organizing special functions.
* Selecting staff, setting staff work schedules, and training and supervising waiting and kitchen staff.
* Conferring with customers to assess their satisfaction with meals and service.

**Step 3: Analyze the required skills and qualifications.**

The job advertisement emphasizes the need for an enthusiastic team leader with strong organizational and people management skills. These skills are implicitly required for a Restaurant Manager role as described in ISCO unit 1412.

**Step 4: Analyze the major, sub-major, and minor groups.**

ISCO unit 1412 falls under:

* Major group 1: Managers
* Sub-major group 14: Hospitality, Retail and Other Services Managers

This classification accurately reflects the managerial nature of the role within the hospitality industry.

**Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 1412
* **ISCO Title:** Restaurant managers
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job title, description, responsibilities, and required skills strongly align with the definition and tasks outlined in ISCO unit 1412. 
* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - No alternative codes are needed as the match to 1412 is very strong.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Domestic Assistant." This title aligns with cleaning and housekeeping duties within a hospital setting. 

2. **Examine responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad emphasizes maintaining cleanliness in the hospital, including tasks like: 
    - Upholding high standards of cleanliness.
    - Following departmental policies and procedures.
    - Working effectively within a team.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad mentions:
    - Good organizational skills.
    - Motivation and teamwork orientation.
    - Reliability and responsibility.
    - Previous cleaning experience is advantageous but not mandatory.

4. **Compare with potential ISCO units:**

    * **5151 (Cleaning and Housekeeping Supervisors):** While the job involves cleaning, it doesn't mention supervisory responsibilities. This unit is less likely.

    * **5152 (Domestic Housekeepers):** This unit is a closer match.  Domestic housekeepers maintain cleanliness in private homes, and this role translates those duties to a hospital environment. However, the ad doesn't mention tasks like managing supplies or supervising other staff, which are typical of housekeepers.

    * **5321 (Health Care Assistants):** This unit focuses on direct patient care, which is not mentioned in the ad.  The focus is solely on cleaning, making this unit less relevant.

    * **5322 (Home-based Personal Care Workers):** Similar to 5321, this unit centers around personal care for individuals in their homes, not cleaning tasks in a hospital.

    * **5329 (Other Personal Care Workers):** This unit is too broad. While it includes some cleaning aspects, it encompasses a wider range of healthcare support services not applicable to this job.

    * **9111 (Domestic Cleaners and Helpers):** This unit aligns strongly with the job description. The tasks described in the ad directly match those of a domestic cleaner, focusing on maintaining cleanliness within a specific environment. 

    * **9112 (Cleaners and Helpers in Offices, Hotels and Other Establishments):** This unit is also a strong match. Although the job is in a hospital, the cleaning tasks are similar to those in other establishments. 

    * **9412 (Kitchen Helpers):** This unit is not relevant as the job description doesn't involve food preparation or kitchen work.

    * **9622 (Odd-job Persons):** This unit is too broad and involves maintenance and repair tasks not mentioned in the ad.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 9112 
**ISCO Title:** Cleaners and Helpers in Offices, Hotels and Other Establishments
**Confidence:** 0.8 
**Reasoning:** The job duties primarily revolve around cleaning and maintaining a hygienic environment within a hospital, aligning strongly with the tasks of cleaners and helpers in various establishments. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 9111, 5152, 5329

**Rationale for Alternatives:**

* **9111 (Domestic Cleaners and Helpers):** This remains a close alternative as the tasks are nearly identical. The distinction lies in the work environment, with 9111 typically associated with private homes.
* **5152 (Domestic Housekeepers):**  This unit could be considered if the role involves some degree of supply management or minor supervisory tasks not explicitly stated in the ad.
* **5329 (Other Personal Care Workers):**  This is less likely but could be relevant if the role includes additional healthcare support tasks not outlined in the advertisement.

    * Supporting the kitchen brigade with cleaning duties.
    * Basic food preparation (where required).
    * Ensuring service is not compromised.
    * Maintaining excellent attention to detail.
    * Working to high standards.

    These responsibilities align strongly with the tasks described for ISCO code 9412: Kitchen Helpers, such as cleaning kitchen areas, washing dishes, preparing ingredients, and assisting cooks/chefs.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The job ad emphasizes the need for reliability, a positive attitude, and a willingness to help. While not mentioning specific qualifications, these traits are consistent with the entry-level nature of Kitchen Helper roles (Skill Level 1).

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:** ISCO code 9412 falls under:
    * Major group 9: Elementary Occupations
    * Sub-major group 94: Food Preparation Assistants

    This categorization accurately reflects the job's nature as a hands-on, support role within a food service environment.

## Final Prediction:

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "FLT Driver (counterbalance) - NIGHTS". This immediately points towards operating a forklift as the primary responsibility. The description confirms this, emphasizing the use of a forklift to move various waste materials.

2. **Examine the main responsibilities and tasks:** The core tasks involve operating a forklift to collect, move, and position waste bins and materials. Additional tasks include manual sorting and operating waste processing machinery.

3. **Consider the required skills and qualifications:** The advertisement explicitly mentions requiring relevant licenses/accreditation for forklift operation. Experience in a busy site environment is desirable.

4. **Compare with provided ISCO units:**

    * **8344 - Lifting truck operators:** This unit perfectly aligns with the job description. The tasks, required skills, and job title all directly correspond to the definition of a lifting truck operator.

5. **Evaluate other ISCO units for potential relevance:**

    * **9333 - Freight handlers:** While the job involves moving materials, the emphasis on forklift operation and specific licensing requirements makes this a less accurate fit than 8344.
    * **9329 - Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified:**  The manual sorting aspect might seem relevant, but the primary role is clearly forklift operation, making this unit unsuitable.
    * **Other ISCO units:** The remaining units focus on different industries and skillsets, making them irrelevant to this job advertisement.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 8344
**ISCO Title:** Lifting-truck operators
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on operating a forklift (lifting truck) as the primary responsibility. The required skills, tasks, and job title all strongly support this classification.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Bus Cleaners," and the description emphasizes cleaning buses and other vehicles. This immediately points towards ISCO units related to vehicle cleaning.

2. **Review ISCO Code 9122 (Vehicle Cleaners):** This unit's description aligns perfectly with the job ad. It involves cleaning and polishing vehicle exteriors and interiors, which are the primary responsibilities mentioned.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:** While some tasks like emptying bins and general cleaning are mentioned, they are secondary to the core duty of bus cleaning. Therefore, units like "Building Structure Cleaners" (7133), "Domestic Cleaners" (9111), or "Cleaners and Helpers" (9112) are less fitting.

4. **Evaluate required skills and qualifications:** The ad mentions previous cleaning experience as advantageous but not mandatory. This aligns with ISCO 9122, which typically falls under elementary occupations requiring minimal prior experience.

5. **Consider the level of expertise and autonomy:** The job ad doesn't suggest a high level of autonomy or specialized skills. This further supports the classification as an elementary occupation like ISCO 9122. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 9122
**ISCO Title:** Vehicle Cleaners
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on cleaning buses and other vehicles, aligning perfectly with the tasks and skill level associated with ISCO 9122 (Vehicle Cleaners).

## Job Advertisement Analysis: Conductor/a de camión mercancias peligrosas

Here is a breakdown of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO code:

**1. Translation & Interpretation:**

* **Title:** Driver of a truck transporting hazardous materials
* **Description:** The job requires a driver for a truck transporting hazardous materials. Essential qualifications include a truck driving license, ADR (European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road) certification, and tanker endorsements. The position is a full-time, temporary contract with the possibility of becoming permanent. The salary is determined by the collective agreement. Experience is not required.

**2. Matching with Potential ISCO Units:**

* **5112 - Transport Conductors:** This unit is immediately ruled out. The job involves driving a truck, not checking tickets and ensuring passenger comfort.
* **8311 - Locomotive Engine Drivers:** This unit is also ruled out. The job explicitly mentions a truck driver, not a train driver.
* **8312 - Railway Brakers, Signallers and Shunters:**  This unit is irrelevant. The job is related to road transport, not railway operations.
* **8321 - Motorcycle Drivers:** This unit is irrelevant. The job requires a truck driver, not a motorcycle driver.
* **8322 - Car, Taxi and Van Drivers:** While this unit involves driving, it doesn't align with the specific requirements of transporting hazardous materials in a truck. 
* **8331 - Bus and Tram Drivers:** This unit is irrelevant. The job requires a truck driver, not a bus or tram driver.
* **8332 - Heavy Truck and Lorry Drivers:** This unit closely matches the job description. It involves driving heavy vehicles to transport goods, aligning with the advertisement's requirement for a truck driver. The mention of "mercancias peligrosas" (hazardous materials) further strengthens this match.
* **8344 - Lifting Truck Operators:** This unit is less relevant. While it involves operating vehicles, the focus is on lifting and stacking pallets within controlled environments, not long-haul transportation of hazardous materials.
* **9331 - Hand and Pedal Vehicle Drivers:** This unit is irrelevant. The job requires a truck driver, not a driver of a non-motorized vehicle.
* **9332 - Drivers of Animal-Drawn Vehicles and Machinery:** This unit is irrelevant. The job requires a truck driver, not a driver of animal-drawn vehicles.

**3. Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code (unit):** 8332
* **ISCO Title:** Heavy Truck and Lorry Drivers
* **Confidence:** 0.9 
* **Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly states the need for a truck driver to transport hazardous materials. This aligns perfectly with the description of ISCO unit 8332, which includes transporting goods and liquids over long distances. The requirement for ADR certification further confirms the handling of dangerous goods. 

* **Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  While 8332 is a strong match, here are three alternative ISCO codes with decreasing relevance:
    * **5321 - Freight Handlers:** If the role involves significant loading/unloading of hazardous materials, this could be a secondary classification.
    * **7531 - Hand Packers and Other Package Handlers:**  Similar to above, if packaging and preparing hazardous materials is a significant part of the job.
    * **3343 - Customs and Border Inspectors:** If the role involves crossing borders and interacting with customs officials due to the hazardous nature of the cargo.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The title "Global People and Culture Operations Manager" strongly suggests a role focused on human resources at a strategic and operational level. This aligns with the description, emphasizing responsibilities like developing HR infrastructure, managing international recruitment, overseeing people management processes, and building capability in good people management practices.

2. **Compare with ISCO unit 1212 - Human resource managers:** This unit's description and tasks heavily resonate with the advertisement. Responsibilities like planning and coordinating personnel activities, recruitment, training, managing employee relations, and ensuring compliance with labor laws are all explicitly mentioned. The job title "Human Resources Manager" listed as an example further strengthens this connection.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:** While other units might touch upon certain aspects of the job, none fit as comprehensively as 1212. 
    * **1120 - Managing Directors and Chief Executives:** While the role involves leadership, it focuses specifically on HR, not the overall direction of the organization.
    * **1114 - Senior officials of special-interest organizations:** This doesn't align with the employer being an international development organization.
    * **1112 - Senior government officials:** The role isn't within a government context.
    * **2423 - Personnel and careers professionals:** This unit focuses more on individual career guidance and job analysis, while the advertised role has a broader scope encompassing HR strategy and operations.
    * **2422 - Policy administration professionals:**  While policy development is involved, the core focus is on HR practices, not broader organizational or governmental policies.
    * **2421 - Management and organization analysts:** This unit emphasizes analyzing and improving organizational structures and efficiency, which is only a small part of the advertised role.
    * **1431 - Sports, recreation and cultural centre managers:** This is entirely unrelated to the job advertisement.
    * **1344 - Social welfare managers:** This unit focuses on social services, not HR within a development organization.
    * **1213 - Policy and planning managers:** While strategic planning is involved, the primary focus is on HR, not general organizational policy and planning. 

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 1212
**ISCO Title:** Human resource managers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on core HR functions such as recruitment, training, policy development, employee relations, and building HR infrastructure. This aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks outlined for ISCO unit 1212. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2423, 1120, 1213

Response:
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title "Staff Nurse - RGN or RPN" immediately points towards a nursing profession.  RGN (Registered General Nurse) and RPN (Registered Practical Nurse) are qualifications that align with professional nursing roles. This suggests ISCO units within Major Group 2: Professionals, specifically Sub-major Group 22: Health Professionals.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job description emphasizes providing nursing care and support, advising on health issues, understanding complex health and social factors related to homelessness and addiction, and working within a multidisciplinary team. These tasks align strongly with the description of ISCO unit 2221: Nursing Professionals. 

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement requires active nursing registration, experience in community or residential settings, and an understanding of harm reduction and low threshold working. These are all typical requirements for professional nursing roles.

4. **ISCO Unit 2221 Alignment:** ISCO unit 2221's detailed description and listed tasks closely match the advertised position. The required skills and experience level further solidify this alignment.

5. **Alternative ISCO Units:**  Given the strong alignment with 2221, exploring alternative ISCO units is unnecessary. The job advertisement clearly falls under the scope of Nursing Professionals.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2221
**ISCO Title:** Nursing Professionals
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job title, required qualifications, and described responsibilities all strongly indicate a professional nursing role, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks outlined in ISCO unit 2221. 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 7321 (Pre-press technicians):** While the job involves printing, it focuses on operating the flexographic press, not pre-press tasks like composing layouts or creating plates. This unit is not a match.

2. **ISCO 7322 (Printers):** This unit's description aligns perfectly with the job ad. The tasks listed, such as setting up, operating, and troubleshooting printing presses, directly match the responsibilities outlined.  The job title "Flexographic Printer" and the required experience operating specific flexographic presses further confirm this as a strong match.

3. **Remaining ISCO Units:**  Given the strong match with ISCO 7322, it's unnecessary to analyze the remaining units. The job ad clearly falls under the scope of "Printers."

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7322
**ISCO Title:** Printers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly focuses on operating a flexographic printing press, aligning perfectly with the description and tasks associated with ISCO 7322 (Printers). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A -  The provided ISCO 7322 is a perfect match, eliminating the need for alternatives.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Jr. Software Developer".  The description emphasizes developing, maintaining, and enhancing software systems. This aligns strongly with the ISCO unit **2512: Software Developers**. 

2. **Review main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists tasks like analyzing requirements, designing and coding software, debugging, and working with databases. These tasks are all core responsibilities of a Software Developer as defined in ISCO unit 2512.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The job requires a Computer Science degree or equivalent experience, plus specific programming skills (Java, JavaScript, SQL). These are typical qualifications for Software Developers (ISCO 2512).

4. **Evaluate major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 2512 falls under:
    - **Major group 2: Professionals** - This fits the job's requirement for a Bachelor's degree and specialized knowledge.
    - **Sub-major group 25: Information and Communications Technology Professionals** - This aligns perfectly with the job's focus on software development. 

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:** While some tasks might superficially relate to other units (e.g., database work could relate to 2521: Database and Network Administrators), the core focus on software development makes 2512 the most accurate.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2512
**ISCO Title:** Software Developers
**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, skills, and required qualifications all strongly align with the definition and scope of ISCO unit 2512: Software Developers.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2519 (Software and applications developers and analysts n.e.c.), 2511 (Systems analysts), 3514 (Web technicians)

Job Ad ID: 725967259, Row: 25462, Pred: 3333, 2423, 2433, 3339, 5244, 2353, 4221, 4229, 3322, 2424
Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Entry level Recruiter with English - Prague". This immediately points towards a role focused on recruitment and personnel.  The description emphasizes finding clients, advertising vacancies, sourcing, screening, and interviewing candidates. This aligns strongly with the tasks and definitions of **ISCO 3333: Employment agents and contractors**.

2. **Compare with related job titles:** ISCO 3333 lists "Employment agent", "Job placement officer", and "Labour contractor" as examples.  The job ad uses "Recruiter" and mentions "headhunting", both closely related terms.

3. **Consider responsibilities and tasks:** The ad lists tasks like managing the recruitment process end-to-end, negotiating with clients and candidates, and filling vacancies. These are core duties of employment agents.

4. **Factor in required skills and qualifications:** The ad emphasizes determination and communication skills, but no prior experience is needed. This fits with the entry-level nature of the role and doesn't contradict ISCO 3333.

5. **Analyze major/sub-major groups:** ISCO 3333 falls under:
    * Major: 3 - Technicians and Associate Professionals
    * Sub-major: 33 - Business and Administration Associate Professionals 
    This aligns well with the job's nature. It's not purely administrative nor requiring advanced professional qualifications.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3333
**ISCO Title:** Employment agents and contractors
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job description heavily emphasizes tasks central to employment agents, such as sourcing candidates, negotiating with clients, and managing the recruitment process. The required skills and entry-level nature also align with this ISCO unit.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 2423, 3322, 2424 

**Explanation of Alternatives:**

While 3333 is a strong match, these alternatives are worth considering due to certain aspects of the job ad:

* **2423: Personnel and careers professionals:** This is relevant because the recruiter role involves some elements of advising clients on personnel needs, though it's not the primary focus.
* **3322: Commercial sales representatives:** The commission-based structure and emphasis on "selling" the job opportunity to candidates have elements of sales, though the core service is recruitment.
* **2424: Training and staff development professionals:** The ad mentions an "award-winning training program" for new recruits. While this is for internal development, it could indicate some overlap with training-related tasks.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Job Title Analysis:** The job title is "Residential Conveyancing Solicitor." This immediately suggests a legal profession focused on property transactions. The provided ISCO units include two highly relevant options: "Lawyers" (2611) and "Legal and related associate professionals" (3411).

2. **Job Description Analysis:** The job description emphasizes managing a caseload of "sales, purchases, re-mortgages, and transfer of equity matters." This confirms the focus on residential conveyancing, a specialized area within law.

3. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The solicitor is expected to handle cases "from initial instruction through to completion," implying a high level of autonomy and expertise. They will also be involved in client development and providing legal advice. These responsibilities align strongly with the tasks described for "Lawyers" (2611).

4. **Skills and Qualifications:**  While the ad doesn't explicitly list qualifications, it implies the need for a qualified solicitor with experience in residential conveyancing. This further supports the classification as a "Lawyer" (2611).

5. **ISCO Unit Comparison:** 
    - **2611 (Lawyers):** This unit perfectly encapsulates the job's nature. The tasks, required expertise, and job title all point towards this classification.
    - **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** While this unit includes roles like "Conveyancing clerk," it doesn't reflect the level of autonomy and client interaction expected of a solicitor.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2611
**ISCO Title:** Lawyers
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly seeks a "Residential Conveyancing Solicitor," a role requiring legal expertise and client management, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks of ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers). 

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):**  N/A - The primary prediction (2611) is a strong match, eliminating the need for alternatives.

Response:
## Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **ISCO 2113: Chemists:** While the job involves laboratory work and analysis, the focus is on microorganisms, not general chemistry. The required skills like PCR and DNA isolation are specific to microbiology, not general chemistry. Thus, this ISCO unit is not the best fit.

2. **ISCO 2131: Biologists, Botanists, Zoologists and Related Professionals:** This unit aligns well with the job description. 
    * **Job Title:** The title "Mikrobiolog" translates directly to "Microbiologist," a listed example occupation.
    * **Tasks:** The job involves culturing, identifying, and analyzing microorganisms using techniques like PCR, DNA isolation, and bioinformatics – all core tasks of microbiologists.
    * **Qualifications:** The ad requires a degree in biotechnology, biology, or a related field, aligning with this ISCO unit.

3. **ISCO 2263: Environmental and occupational health and hygiene professionals:** This unit focuses on workplace and environmental safety and health. While some aspects of microbiology relate to these fields, this job focuses on research and analysis, not safety program implementation. Therefore, this ISCO unit is not suitable.

4. **ISCO 3111: Chemical and physical science technicians:** This unit involves assisting scientists in chemistry and physics. The Mikrobiolog role focuses on independent research and analysis, exceeding the scope of a technician role. This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

6. **ISCO 3141: Life science technicians (excluding medical):** While this unit involves laboratory work with living organisms, it emphasizes providing technical support to scientists. The Mikrobiolog position requires independent research, analysis, and method optimization, indicating a higher level of expertise than a technician. 

7. **ISCO 3142: Agricultural technicians:** This unit focuses on supporting agricultural research and practices. Although microbiology is relevant to agriculture, this job's focus on environmental microbiology and biotechnology research goes beyond the scope of an agricultural technician.

8. **ISCO 3143: Forestry technicians:** This unit is not relevant as it deals with forest management and research, not microbiology.

9. **ISCO 3212: Medical and pathology laboratory technicians:** This unit focuses on clinical testing for patient health. The advertised position involves environmental and research-oriented microbiology, making this ISCO unit unsuitable.

10. **ISCO 6221: Aquaculture workers:** This unit is irrelevant as it deals with breeding and raising aquatic life, not microbiology.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 2131
**ISCO Title:** Biologists, Botanists, Zoologists and Related Professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9 
**Reasoning:** The job title, description, tasks, and required qualifications strongly align with the definition and tasks of a Microbiologist, which falls under this ISCO unit.

2. **Main Responsibilities and Tasks:** The job advertisement emphasizes maintenance, repair, inspection, and servicing of motorbikes. These tasks align perfectly with the description provided for ISCO code 7231. 

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement requires experience as a motorcycle technician and a formal qualification like City & Guilds/NVQ Level 3. This indicates a skill level aligning with ISCO's skill level 2 (medium), which is consistent with ISCO code 7231.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Group Alignment:** ISCO code 7231 falls under Major group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers), Sub-major group 72 (Metal, Machinery and Related Trades Workers). This categorization accurately reflects the nature of the advertised job.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 7231
**ISCO Title:** Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers

## Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyzing the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Veterinary Assistant," and the description emphasizes tasks like animal care, assisting with operations, and general clinic duties. This points towards a role providing support to Veterinarians.

2. **Evaluating ISCO Code 2250 (Veterinarians):** While the ad mentions "assistance with operations," it lacks the requirement for diagnosing or independently treating animals, which are core duties of a Veterinarian. This code is not a match.

3. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3141 (Life science technicians):** This code focuses on laboratory research and analysis, not direct animal care or assisting in a clinical setting. This is not a suitable match.

4. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3142 (Agricultural technicians):** This code is more focused on crop and livestock management, not companion animal care in a clinical setting. This is not a match.

5. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3212 (Medical and pathology laboratory technicians):** This code deals with human bodily fluids and tissues, not animal care. This is not a match.

6. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3213 (Pharmaceutical technicians and assistants):** This code focuses on dispensing human medication, not animal medication. This is not a match.

7. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3230 (Traditional and complementary medicine associate professionals):** This code focuses on human-focused traditional healing practices, not conventional veterinary care. This is not a match.

8. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3240 (Veterinary technicians and assistants):** This code perfectly aligns with the job advertisement. It includes tasks like assisting veterinarians, caring for animals, preparing for procedures, and performing routine tasks under guidance. This is a strong match.

9. **Evaluating ISCO Code 3252 (Medical records and health information technicians):** This code focuses on medical record management, not direct animal care or assisting veterinarians. This is not a match.

10. **Evaluating ISCO Code 5164 (Pet groomers and animal care workers):** While this code includes animal care, it emphasizes grooming and basic tasks. The advertisement suggests a more clinical environment and assisting with medical procedures, making this code less specific.

11. **Evaluating ISCO Code 5329 (Other personal care workers in health services):** This code is too broad and encompasses various healthcare support roles. The advertisement clearly focuses on veterinary-specific tasks. This is not a match.

## Final Prediction:

**ISCO Code (unit):** 3240
**ISCO Title:** Veterinary technicians and assistants
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job advertisement explicitly describes the role of a veterinary assistant, aligning perfectly with the tasks and responsibilities outlined in ISCO code 3240.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Group Cycle Workout Instructor." The description emphasizes delivering group workouts (spinning, bodypump, circuit training), motivating clients, ensuring safety, and staying up-to-date with fitness trends.  A REPs 2 qualification is required.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **3423 - Fitness and recreation instructors and programme leaders:** This unit's description closely aligns with the advertisement.  Tasks like leading fitness activities, instructing equipment use, and enforcing safety procedures are all mentioned. The "fitness instructor" and "personal trainer" examples are relevant.  The requirement of a REPs 2 qualification further strengthens this match.

    * **Other Provided ISCO Units:**  The other ISCO units are less relevant.  They focus on management (1431), physiotherapy (2264, 3255), personnel work (2423), social work (3412), athletes (3421), sports coaches/officials (3422), bicycle repair (7234), and hand/pedal vehicle drivers (9331). None of these align with the core duties of a group cycle instructor.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    * **ISCO Code:** 3423
    * **ISCO Title:** Fitness and recreation instructors and programme leaders
    * **Confidence:** 1.0

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Seafreight Import Clerk." The description emphasizes tasks related to handling sea freight imports, including liaising with international parties, managing documentation, arranging deliveries, and coordinating with shipping lines.  The role requires experience in logistics/freight, customer service skills, and knowledge of import procedures.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **3324 - Trade Brokers:** While the job involves international trade, the clerk doesn't buy or sell commodities or shipping services. This ISCO unit focuses on negotiation and market analysis, which are not primary responsibilities in the advertisement.
    * **3331 - Clearing and Forwarding Agents:** This is a strong match. The job description aligns with many of the tasks listed, such as handling customs clearance procedures, managing import documentation, and liaising with shipping lines.
    * **4110 - General Office Clerks:** While the job involves some general clerical tasks, the specific focus on sea freight import procedures and international communication makes this ISCO unit too broad.
    * **4312 - Statistical, Finance and Insurance Clerks:** The job doesn't involve statistical analysis, financial transactions, or insurance processing.
    * **4321 - Stock Clerks:** While the job involves managing goods, the focus is on the import process rather than stock control and warehousing.
    * **4323 - Transport Clerks:** This ISCO unit is closer than general office clerks, but the focus is broader than sea freight imports, encompassing various transport modes. The job description doesn't mention coordinating transport schedules or preparing management reports, which are key tasks for this unit.
    * **4412 - Mail Carriers and Sorting Clerks:** This is clearly not a match, as the job doesn't involve mail handling or postal services.
    * **6223 - Deep-sea Fishery Workers:**  Completely irrelevant to the job advertisement.
    * **8350 - Ship’s Deck Crews and Related Workers:**  Irrelevant to the job advertisement.
    * **9333 - Freight Handlers:** This involves manual handling of freight, whereas the advertised role is clerical and administrative.

3. **Determine the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit:** The closest match is **3331 - Clearing and Forwarding Agents**. The job description explicitly mentions tasks central to this ISCO unit, such as handling import documentation, customs procedures, and liaising with shipping lines.

ISCO Code: **3331**
ISCO Title: **Clearing and Forwarding Agents**
Confidence: **0.9**
Reasoning: The job responsibilities align strongly with the tasks and description of Clearing and Forwarding Agents, including handling import documentation, customs procedures, and coordinating with shipping lines.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **1311 (Agricultural and forestry production managers):** This is clearly irrelevant, as the job is in chemical manufacturing, not agriculture or forestry.
    * **1312 (Aquaculture and fisheries production managers):**  Also irrelevant due to the industry mismatch.
    * **1321 (Manufacturing managers):** This is a strong potential match. The job title aligns, and the description of planning, directing, and coordinating production activities, managing budgets, and overseeing staff aligns with the advertisement. The focus on chemical manufacturing in the ad further strengthens this match.
    * **1322 (Mining managers):** Irrelevant, as the job is not in mining, quarrying, or oil/gas extraction.
    * **2113 (Chemists):** While a chemistry background is desired, this unit focuses on research and development, not management. The job ad clearly emphasizes managerial responsibilities.
    * **2141 (Industrial and production engineers):**  This focuses on engineering aspects like design, construction, and maintenance of industrial processes. While related, the core of the advertised role is management, not engineering.
    * **2145 (Chemical engineers):** Similar to 2113, this is more focused on the engineering and technical aspects of chemical processes, not management.
    * **3122 (Manufacturing supervisors):** While some tasks overlap, this unit is at a lower level of responsibility than the advertised role. The Production Manager will manage supervisors, not be one.
    * **3133 (Chemical processing plant controllers):** This is an operational role focused on monitoring and controlling machinery, not managing a department and leading a team.
    * **8131 (Chemical products plant and machine operators):** This is a hands-on operator role, far below the managerial level described in the advertisement.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 1321
ISCO Title: Manufacturing managers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description strongly align with the definition of Manufacturing Managers, particularly given the emphasis on chemical manufacturing, budget management, staff leadership, and overall production responsibility.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None. The provided 1321 is a perfect match, making alternatives unnecessary.

Response:
Job Advertisement Translation:
Title: Real Estate Agent, Saaremaa region
Description: Real estate agent, Saaremaa region. The job involves helping people buy and sell real estate. The work is very exciting and offers opportunities for great development and earnings, as well as the opportunity to work as an entrepreneur.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Analyze the top-ranked ISCO unit (3315 - Valuers and loss assessors):** This unit focuses on assessing the value of properties and losses, not selling or facilitating transactions.  Therefore, it's not a good fit.

2. **Analyze the second-ranked ISCO unit (3321 - Insurance representatives):** This unit deals with selling insurance, which is not relevant to the real estate agent role described.

3. **Analyze the third-ranked ISCO unit (3322 - Commercial sales representatives):** While this involves sales, it focuses on selling goods and services to businesses, not real estate to individuals.  Thus, it's not the best match.

4. **Analyze the fourth-ranked ISCO unit (3324 - Trade brokers):** This unit focuses on commodities and shipping services, not real estate. Therefore, it's not suitable.

5. **Analyze the fifth-ranked ISCO unit (3333 - Employment agents and contractors):** This unit is about matching jobseekers with vacancies, not real estate transactions.  It's not relevant.

6. **Analyze the sixth-ranked ISCO unit (3334 - Real estate agents and property managers):** This unit's description perfectly matches the job advertisement. The tasks described, such as arranging sales and purchases of real estate, facilitating negotiations, and drawing up agreements, align directly with the advertised role.

7. **Analyze the seventh-ranked ISCO unit (3339 - Business services agents not elsewhere classified):** While this is a broad category, 3334 is a more specific and accurate match.  The examples within 3339 (auctioneer, literary agent, etc.) are not relevant.

8. **Analyze the eighth-ranked ISCO unit (5211 - Stall and market salespersons):** This unit describes selling goods from stalls or markets, which is not the same as selling real estate.

9. **Analyze the ninth-ranked ISCO unit (5223 - Shop sales assistants):** This unit describes selling goods in shops, not real estate.

10. **Analyze the tenth-ranked ISCO unit (5242 - Sales demonstrators):** This unit focuses on demonstrating goods, not facilitating real estate transactions.

Final Prediction:
ISCO Code: 3334
ISCO Title: Real estate agents and property managers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description clearly indicate a role focused on facilitating real estate transactions, which aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks of ISCO unit 3334.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Carpenter." The description mentions "Carpenters (inside works) building a new house." This strongly suggests tasks related to carpentry within a residential construction context.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO descriptions and titles:** ISCO 7115 (Carpenters and Joiners) has a very close match in both title and description. The description of 7115 includes tasks like making, altering, and repairing structural woodwork, constructing wooden structures, and fitting internal and external fixtures, all of which align with the general duties of a carpenter building a new house.  The provided list also includes "Carpenter" as a similar job title for this ISCO unit.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The advertisement mentions "Experience of at least 5 years," indicating a skilled position, which aligns with the Skill Level 2 (medium) designation of ISCO 7115.

4. **Evaluate other potentially relevant ISCO units:** While 7111 (House Builders) also relates to house construction, it focuses on the overall building process, often involving coordinating subcontractors.  The advertisement doesn't mention such responsibilities. Other ISCO units like 7114 (Concrete placers...), 7119 (Building frame...), 7121 (Roofers), 7122 (Floor layers...), 7124 (Insulation workers), 7522 (Cabinet-makers...), 9313 (Building construction labourers), and 9622 (Odd-job persons) are less relevant based on the job title and description focusing on carpentry work.

ISCO Code: 7115
ISCO Title: Carpenters and Joiners
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description directly mention carpentry work in building a new house.  ISCO 7115's description and listed tasks align perfectly with these duties. The required experience reinforces the skill level associated with this ISCO unit.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title "Construction and Property Law" and the description indicate a legal focus related to construction and property. The main task is preparing a case note analyzing a specific legal case within this domain. This requires legal expertise, research skills, and the ability to apply legal principles to a real-world scenario.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is the most relevant unit.  The job requires legal analysis and writing, core tasks of lawyers. While the ad doesn't explicitly mention representing clients in court, legal case analysis is a fundamental skill for lawyers.
    * **2619 (Legal Professionals not elsewhere classified):** Less relevant than 2611.  This unit covers legal professionals *not* primarily engaged in pleading or prosecuting. The job ad's focus on case analysis suggests a higher level of legal expertise than typically associated with this unit.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** Even less relevant. This unit involves support functions in legal settings. The job ad requires in-depth legal analysis, exceeding the typical scope of a paralegal or legal assistant role.
    * **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining ISCO units focus on construction management, architecture, real estate, secretarial work, or manual labor, none of which align with the job advertisement's legal emphasis.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
    * The job title explicitly mentions "Law."
    * The description emphasizes legal case analysis.
    * The required skills align with legal expertise, research, and writing.
    * ISCO 2611 (Lawyers) encompasses these aspects.

ISCO Code (unit): 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job requires legal expertise in construction and property law, specifically case analysis, aligning perfectly with the lawyer profession.

Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 2619, 3411, 2421 (University and Higher Education Teachers – if the case study is for academic purposes).

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Van Technician." The description emphasizes repairing and maintaining light commercial vehicles (LCVs), diagnosing faults, and conducting standard automotive services.  The required qualifications include NVQL3 or equivalent and experience working on cars or commercials.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **7231 (Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers):** This is a strong match. The job description closely aligns with the tasks listed for this unit, such as diagnosing faults, replacing parts, and performing maintenance.  The mention of LCVs (vans) falls under the scope of "motor vehicles."
    * **3115 (Mechanical engineering technicians):** While there's an element of mechanical work, this unit focuses on research, design, and manufacturing, which are not the primary responsibilities in the advertisement.
    * **3240 (Veterinary technicians and assistants):**  Clearly not relevant, as the job deals with vehicles, not animals.
    * **7232 (Aircraft engine mechanics and repairers):** Not relevant, the job is for van/LCV technicians.
    * **7233 (Agricultural and industrial machinery mechanics and repairers):**  While there's overlap in mechanical skills, the focus here is on machinery other than motor vehicles.  LCVs are specifically motor vehicles.
    * **7234 (Bicycle and related repairers):** Not relevant, the job is for van/LCV technicians.
    * **7412 (Electrical mechanics and fitters):**  This might be relevant if the job involved significant electrical work on the vans, but the advertisement emphasizes mechanical repairs and maintenance.
    * **8211 (Mechanical machinery assemblers):** Assembly is not the primary focus of the job. The advertisement emphasizes repair and maintenance.
    * **9122 (Vehicle cleaners):** Not relevant, as cleaning is a minor aspect compared to the mechanical work.
    * **9331 (Hand and pedal vehicle drivers):** Not relevant, the job is for van/LCV technicians.

3. **Determine the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit:** Based on the analysis, 7231 (Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers) is the most appropriate ISCO unit.

ISCO Code: 7231
ISCO Title: Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description directly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of a motor vehicle mechanic, including diagnosing faults, repairing and replacing parts, and performing maintenance on LCVs, which are a type of motor vehicle.
Alternative ISCO Codes: 7233, 7412, 8211

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Commercial Property Solicitor." The description emphasizes legal work within real estate/commercial property law, including tasks like handling sales & purchases, freehold & lease transactions, and development work across various property portfolios.  The role requires 1-4 years of post-qualification experience (PQE) as a solicitor and specific experience in real estate law.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2161 (Building architects):** This is immediately irrelevant.  Architects design buildings, not handle legal matters related to them.
    * **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):**  Also irrelevant. This unit deals with HR functions, not legal work.
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is a strong match. The job title "Solicitor" is explicitly listed as an example occupation. The description of lawyers includes giving legal advice, drawing up legal documents (contracts, real estate transactions), and representing clients.  This aligns perfectly with the advertisement.
    * **2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** While related to law, this unit covers roles like coroners and notaries.  The solicitor role is clearly defined within 2611.
    * **3315 (Valuers and loss assessors):**  Not a match. This unit focuses on property valuation, not legal work.
    * **3322 (Commercial sales representatives):** Irrelevant. This is a sales role, not a legal one.
    * **3334 (Real estate agents and property managers):** While the job deals with real estate, this unit focuses on sales, rental, and property management, not legal aspects.
    * **3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified):**  Irrelevant. This is a broad category for agents not fitting other classifications, and the solicitor role is already covered by 2611.
    * **3342 (Legal secretaries):**  While working in a legal environment, this is a support role, not a qualified legal professional like a solicitor.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** This includes paralegals and legal assistants. While the solicitor might supervise such roles, their work is distinct and at a higher professional level, fitting 2611.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job advertisement explicitly mentions "solicitor," a profession directly listed under this ISCO unit.  The job responsibilities align perfectly with the description of a lawyer specializing in commercial property.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.  2611 is a perfect fit.  No other provided codes are remotely relevant.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job advertisement is for a Nail Technician in a luxury salon.  Key responsibilities include performing nail treatments (acrylics, gels), nail art, and providing excellent client service.  The required skills include experience with high-end nail techniques, client-facing skills, and the ability to work in a team.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **5142 - Beauticians and related workers:** This is the most relevant unit. The job description mentions manicures and pedicures, which align with the tasks of a beautician.  The focus on nail art and specialized techniques also fits within the scope of improving clients' appearance.
    * **5141 - Hairdressers:** This unit is less relevant. While both involve beauty services, hairdressing is a distinct skill set from nail care.
    * **5164 - Pet groomers and animal care workers:** This is not relevant, as the job is focused on human clients, not animals.
    * **3255 - Physiotherapy technicians and assistants:** This is not relevant.  Physiotherapy focuses on physical rehabilitation, not beauty treatments.
    * **3230 - Traditional and complementary medicine associate professionals:** This is not relevant.  While some nail treatments might have therapeutic benefits, the primary focus of this role is aesthetic.
    * **3221 - Nursing associate professionals:** This is not relevant. Nursing involves medical care, not beauty services.
    * **3214 - Medical and dental prosthetic technicians:** This is not relevant.  Prosthetics involve creating and fitting medical devices, not nail treatments.
    * **3213 - Pharmaceutical technicians and assistants:** This is not relevant. This role involves dispensing medications, not beauty treatments.
    * **3142 - Agricultural technicians:** This is not relevant. This role involves agricultural work, not beauty services.
    * **3112 - Civil engineering technicians:** This is not relevant. This role involves construction and engineering, not beauty services.


3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 5142
ISCO Title: Beauticians and related workers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job duties align perfectly with the description of beauticians, including nail care, client interaction, and focus on appearance enhancement.  The emphasis on specialized nail techniques further reinforces this classification.
Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):  None.  5142 is a precise fit.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Refuse Loader." The description emphasizes collecting refuse, loading it onto a vehicle, and working as part of a team.  This aligns strongly with the tasks and titles associated with garbage collection.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The primary duties involve physically collecting refuse from various locations and loading it onto a collection vehicle.  This is a manual labor job with a focus on waste removal.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:**  The advertisement highlights the need for physical fitness, courtesy, and helpfulness.  While experience in waste management is desirable, it's not essential, suggesting a lower skill level requirement.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:**  The most relevant ISCO units provided fall under Major Group 9 (Elementary Occupations). This aligns with the manual labor and lower skill requirements of the job.  Within this major group, Sub-major 96 (Refuse Workers and Other Elementary Workers) is a direct match.

5. **Comparison with provided ISCO units:**
    * **9611 (Garbage collectors):** This is a very strong match. The job description and tasks align perfectly with the definition of this unit.
    * **Other provided ISCO units:**  None of the other provided ISCO units (Incinerator and water treatment plant operators, Heavy truck and lorry drivers, Lifting truck operators, Livestock farm labourers, Building construction labourers, Hand and pedal vehicle drivers, Freight handlers, Refuse sorters, Sweepers and related labourers) align with the job description.  They involve different skill sets, responsibilities, and work environments.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 9611
ISCO Title: Garbage collectors
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description directly match the definition and tasks of a Garbage collector (ISCO 9611). The focus on manual refuse collection and loading, along with the requirement for physical fitness, further strengthens this classification.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  N/A -  The primary prediction (9611) is a perfect match, so no alternatives are necessary.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title "Dealer Casino Online -Turca" translates to "Online Casino Dealer - Turkish." The description translates to: "Responsibilities: - Present the game in a professional manner; - Perform all game operations, in accordance with the standards required by efficiency, security and customer satisfaction; - Involve players in the live game experience. Benefits: - motivating salary; - flexible schedule in shifts; - performance bonuses and bonuses; - specialized training; - young and dynamic work environment." This indicates a role involving conducting live online casino games for Turkish-speaking players.

2. **Analysis of Provided ISCO Units:**
    * **1431 (Casino Manager):** While the ad mentions a casino setting, the described responsibilities are not managerial.  The job focuses on conducting games, not managing the establishment.
    * **2424 (Training and Staff Development Professional):** This is irrelevant. The ad doesn't mention training others. The "training" mentioned is for the dealer themselves.
    * **2636 (Religious Professional):** Completely irrelevant to the job description.
    * **2655 (Actor):** While there's a performance aspect to the job, it's not acting in the traditional sense.  The dealer interacts with players but doesn't portray a fictional character.
    * **3421 (Athlete and Sports Player):** Irrelevant.  This is about competing in sports, not running casino games.
    * **3422 (Sports Coach, Instructor, Official):**  Irrelevant.  No coaching or instruction is involved.
    * **3435 (Artistic and Cultural Associate Professional):**  While closer than some options due to the performance aspect, the core duties don't align with the examples provided.
    * **4212 (Bookmaker and Croupier):** This is the closest match. Croupiers conduct games of chance, which aligns with the dealer's responsibilities.
    * **5230 (Cashier and Ticket Clerk):**  While handling transactions might be a minor part of the job, it's not the primary function.
    * **5244 (Contact Centre Salesperson):** Irrelevant.  The focus is not on sales.

3. **Conclusion:** The closest match among the provided ISCO units is 4212 (Bookmaker and Croupier). However, the online nature of the job and the emphasis on player interaction suggest a more specific classification might be warranted if available.

**ISCO Code (unit):** 4212
**ISCO Title:** Bookmaker and Croupier
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Reasoning:**  The dealer's responsibilities of conducting casino games align with the core duties of a croupier.  The online aspect isn't fully captured by this ISCO unit, but it's the most appropriate among the choices.

**Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):** 9612 (Gambling and Lottery Machine Operators), 5223 (Shop Sales Assistants), 3434 (Other Artistic and Cultural Associate Professionals).  These are provided as potentially closer alternatives if the strict ISCO structure doesn't allow for nuances like the online nature of the job. 9612 is chosen for its connection to gambling, though it usually refers to machine operation. 5223 is chosen due to the customer interaction and service aspect of the role. 3434 is a broader category that might encompass the performance element if a more specific fit isn't available.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job advertisement is for a Hairdresser (Frizer) in Maribor, Slovenia.  The responsibilities include men's, women's, and children's haircuts, and men's styling.  Requirements include completion of hairdressing school and preferably two years of experience.

2. **ISCO 5141: Hairdressers:** This is a direct match. The job title, description, and tasks align perfectly with the definition of a hairdresser.  The required skills (haircutting, styling) are core to this ISCO unit.

3. **Other ISCO Units:**  Given the clear match with 5141, there's no need to consider the other ISCO units in detail. They are all less relevant.  For example, 5142 (Beauticians) involves other beauty treatments, 5164 (Models) is about displaying clothing, 7531 (Tailors) focuses on clothing construction, 7535 (Pelt Dressers) deals with animal hides, 8154 (Bleaching/Dyeing Machine Operators) involves machine operation in textile production, 8155 (Fur/Leather Preparing Machine Operators) is about machine operation in leather and fur processing, 9411 (Fast Food Preparers) is about food preparation, and 9622 (Odd-job Persons) involves general building maintenance and repairs.  None of these align with the hairdresser job advertisement.

Final Prediction:
ISCO Code: 5141
ISCO Title: Hairdressers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, tasks, and required skills directly match the ISCO 5141 definition of Hairdressers.
Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The advertisement is for a Legal Officer in the Army.  The role involves providing legal advice, prosecuting at court-martial, advising commanders, and training personnel on military law and related areas.  The ad specifies that qualified Solicitors, Barristers, or Advocates are eligible.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**

* **ISCO 110 - Commissioned Armed Forces Officers:** While the role is within the Army and involves the rank of Captain, the primary duties are legal, not general command or leadership.  Therefore, this is not the best fit.
* **ISCO 210 - Non-commissioned Armed Forces Officers:** This is even less relevant, as the role requires legal qualifications and involves advising senior commanders, which is not typical for non-commissioned officers.
* **ISCO 310 - Armed Forces Occupations, Other Ranks:** This is clearly not applicable, as the role requires professional legal qualifications and is an officer position.
* **ISCO 2423 - Personnel and careers professionals:** While the role involves some training, the core responsibilities are legal, not personnel management.  This is not a suitable match.
* **ISCO 2611 - Lawyers:** This is a strong match. The job description emphasizes legal advice, prosecution, and representing the Army in legal matters, aligning perfectly with the definition of a lawyer.
* **ISCO 2619 - Legal Professionals not elsewhere classified:** While encompassing other legal professions, the core duties described in the ad align more specifically with the lawyer definition in 2611.
* **ISCO 3333 - Employment agents and contractors:** This is entirely unrelated to the job advertisement.
* **ISCO 3342 - Legal secretaries:**  The role requires a qualified lawyer, not a legal secretary.  The responsibilities far exceed secretarial duties.
* **ISCO 3411 - Legal and related associate professionals:** This unit includes paralegals and other legal support staff. The advertised role requires a qualified lawyer, placing it at a higher professional level.
* **ISCO 5412 - Police officers:** This is not relevant to the job description.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job advertisement explicitly seeks qualified lawyers (Solicitors, Barristers, Advocates) to perform legal duties within the Army.  The description emphasizes providing legal advice, prosecuting cases, and representing the Army's interests, all core functions of a lawyer.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Graphic Designer." The description emphasizes creating visual materials for various media (digital and print), including websites, brochures, logos, and e-learning modules.  The role requires proficiency in design software (Adobe Creative Suite), understanding of brand guidelines, and knowledge of CSS and HTML.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2163 - Product and garment designers:** This is not a match. The job ad focuses on visual communication, not product design or manufacturing.
    * **2166 - Graphic and multimedia designers:** This is a strong match. The job title and description align with the ISCO definition, which includes designing visual content for various media. The tasks listed in the ISCO unit, such as creating graphics and layouts, also match the job responsibilities.
    * **2431 - Advertising and marketing professionals:** While there's an element of marketing involved in graphic design, this role is primarily focused on the creation of visuals, not developing marketing strategies.
    * **2513 - Web and multimedia development professionals:**  While the job requires some HTML/CSS knowledge, the primary focus is on design, not web development.  This ISCO unit emphasizes programming and scripting, which is not the core of the advertised role.
    * **2651 - Visual artists:** This is a related but not as precise a match as 2166. While graphic design is a visual art form, this ISCO unit is broader and encompasses fine arts like sculpting and painting, which are not mentioned in the job ad.
    * **3118 - Draughtspersons:** This is not a match. Draughtspersons focus on technical drawings, not visual communication design.
    * **3432 - Interior designers and decorators:** This is not a match. The job is about graphic design, not interior spaces.
    * **7316 - Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers:** This is not a match. This ISCO unit focuses on manual and craft-based decoration, not digital graphic design.
    * **7321 - Pre-press technicians:** While related to graphic design, this role focuses on the technical preparation of files for printing, not the design itself.
    * **7534 - Upholsterers and related workers:** This is clearly not a match.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2166
ISCO Title: Graphic and multimedia designers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, required skills (Adobe Creative Suite, HTML/CSS), and tasks align perfectly with the ISCO definition of graphic and multimedia designers.  The job involves creating visual content for various media, both print and digital.

1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The advertisement is for "Childcare Educarers" in Dublin, Ireland.  The ad emphasizes educational and care aspects, highlighting the importance of educators and their relationships with children and families.  A specific qualification (at least a higher-level vocational training degree in early childhood education) is required.  The ad mentions "educators" and working "in early childhood education."

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**

* **2342 - Early Childhood Educators:** This is the most relevant option. The job title ("Childcare Educarers"), required qualification, and emphasis on education and child development align perfectly with the description of Early Childhood Educators. The tasks described for this ISCO unit, such as planning activities, promoting language development, and observing children's progress, are all likely part of the advertised role.

* **Other ISCO Units:** The other provided ISCO units are less suitable:
    * **1341 - Child care services managers:** This focuses on management and administrative tasks, not directly on educating and caring for children.
    * **1345 - Education managers:** This is too broad and geared towards managing educational institutions, not working directly with young children.
    * **2351 - Special needs teachers:**  The ad doesn't mention working with children with special needs.
    * **2353 - Other language teachers:** This is irrelevant as the ad focuses on general childcare and education, not language teaching.
    * **2359 - Other teaching professionals:** While broader, this still doesn't capture the core duties described in the ad as well as 2342.
    * **3333 - Employment agents and contractors:** This is completely unrelated to childcare or education.
    * **5311 - Child care workers:** While related to childcare, this unit focuses more on basic care tasks and less on the educational aspects emphasized in the ad.  The required qualification mentioned in the ad also suggests a higher level of skill than typical for this category.
    * **5312 - Teachers’ aides:** This involves assisting teaching staff, not being the primary educator.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2342
ISCO Title: Early Childhood Educators
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, required qualifications, and description strongly suggest a role focused on the educational and developmental aspects of childcare, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks of Early Childhood Educators.

Alternative ISCO Codes: 5311, 5312, 1341 (These are provided for completeness, but the confidence in 2342 is very high, making alternatives unlikely).

Job Ad ID: 863812254, Row: 25442, Pred: 7231, 9122, 8332, 8322, 7232, 7412, 7421, 7127, 7234, 9331
Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "LCV Technician / Van Mechanic."  LCV stands for Light Commercial Vehicle. This points towards vehicle repair and maintenance.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The job description emphasizes repairing vehicles according to manufacturer procedures, fault diagnosis, complying with warranty procedures, road testing, and reporting defects. These tasks align with the duties of a motor vehicle mechanic.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires previous experience as an LCV Technician/Van Mechanic, a formal qualification (NVQ level 3 or equivalent), and owning tools.  These requirements indicate a skilled trade.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The most relevant ISCO unit provided, 7231 (Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers), falls under Major group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers) and Sub-major group 72 (Metal, Machinery and Related Trades Workers). This alignment is appropriate given the technical and hands-on nature of the job.

5. **Comparison with other ISCO units:** While other ISCO units involve repair work, they are less specific or relevant:
    * 7232 (Aircraft engine mechanics and repairers) deals with aircraft, not vehicles.
    * 7234 (Bicycle and related repairers) focuses on non-motorized vehicles.
    * 7412 (Electrical mechanics and fitters) is broader and doesn't focus specifically on vehicle repair.
    * 7421 (Electronics mechanics and servicers) is even less relevant, dealing with electronic equipment.
    * 8322 (Car, taxi and van drivers) involves driving, not repairing vehicles.
    * 8332 (Heavy truck and lorry drivers) is also a driving role.
    * 9122 (Vehicle cleaners) involves cleaning, not repairing.
    * 9331 (Hand and pedal vehicle drivers) is irrelevant.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 7231
ISCO Title: Motor vehicle mechanics and repairers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description clearly outlines tasks related to vehicle repair and maintenance. The required skills and qualifications match those of a motor vehicle mechanic.  The job title explicitly mentions "Mechanic."  ISCO 7231 aligns perfectly.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title "QA - Automation" and the description clearly point to a role focused on software quality assurance through automated testing.  The primary skills mentioned (mobile and web application testing, SQL, Agile methodology) reinforce this.

2. **Evaluate ISCO 2519 (Software and applications developers and analysts n.e.c.):** This unit explicitly includes software testing and quality assurance. The tasks described in the ISCO 2519 definition, such as developing testing plans, installing software for testing, verifying program functionality, and documenting test results, directly align with the job description. The job title "Quality assurance analyst (computers)" listed as an example occupation further strengthens this match.

3. **Consider Other ISCO Units:** While other ISCO units relate to IT, they don't have the same level of precision. ISCO 2512 (Software developers) is too broad and focuses on software development rather than testing. ISCO 2513 (Web and multimedia development professionals) is also not a good fit, as the job ad doesn't mention multimedia development. ISCO 2514 (Applications programmers) is closer but focuses on writing code, not testing it.  The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant, focusing on systems analysis, database/network administration, civil engineering, agricultural technology, and product grading/testing in non-food industries.

ISCO Code (unit): 2519
ISCO Title: Software and applications developers and analysts n.e.c.
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description explicitly focuses on software quality assurance and automated testing, which aligns perfectly with the ISCO 2519 definition and example occupations. The required skills and tasks mentioned in the job ad directly correspond to the tasks outlined for this unit.

Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): 2514, 2512, 2529.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The advertisement describes a postdoctoral research position focused on designing, synthesizing, and biologically evaluating new radiopharmaceuticals.  The research involves radioactive materials (alpha and Auger emitters) and their application in cancer treatment.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2111 (Physicists and Astronomers):** While the research involves radiation, the core responsibilities are not focused on the physics of radiation itself. The job is centered on chemical synthesis and biological studies, not the physical properties of radiation.  Therefore, this is not a good fit.
    * **2113 (Chemists):** This is a strong match. The job description emphasizes design, synthesis, and biological studies of radiopharmaceuticals, which aligns perfectly with the tasks of a chemist, particularly one specializing in radiochemistry.
    * **2145 (Chemical Engineers):**  The job does not involve scaling up chemical processes or designing chemical plants, which are key responsibilities of chemical engineers. This is not a suitable match.
    * **2262 (Pharmacists):** While the research relates to pharmaceuticals, the role is research-focused, not on dispensing or counseling patients about medications. This is not a good fit.
    * **3111 (Chemical and Physical Science Technicians):**  A postdoctoral researcher typically operates with a higher level of autonomy and expertise than a technician. The job description indicates leading research, not assisting scientists.
    * **3116 (Chemical Engineering Technicians):** This is not relevant, as the job is not focused on chemical plant design or operation.
    * **3211 (Medical Imaging and Therapeutic Equipment Technicians):** The research involves using radioactive materials for therapy, but the role is not focused on operating imaging equipment or administering radiation treatments to patients.
    * **3212 (Medical and Pathology Laboratory Technicians):** While laboratory work is involved, the focus is on developing new radiopharmaceuticals, not performing routine clinical tests.
    * **3213 (Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants):** This is not a good fit, as the role is research-focused, not on dispensing medications.
    * **8131 (Chemical products plant and machine operators):** This is not relevant to the advertised position. The job is research-based, not focused on operating machinery in a chemical plant.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    * **ISCO Code:** 2113
    * **ISCO Title:** Chemists
    * **Confidence:** 1.0
    * **Reasoning:** The job description clearly focuses on the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of new radiopharmaceuticals, which aligns directly with the core tasks and responsibilities of a chemist specializing in radiochemistry or radiopharmaceutical chemistry.  The postdoctoral level implies independent research and development of new chemical entities.

    * **Alternative ISCO Codes:** 2131 (Biochemists and Biophysicists), 2146 (Life science technicians), 3142 (Biological technicians).  These are provided as backups in case a stricter interpretation of "chemist" excludes work with biological systems. However, the primary classification (2113) is highly confident.

Job Ad ID: 789940368, Row: 25439, Pred: 3221, 2221, 5321, 5329, 2240, 2212, 2269, 3259, 5322, 3252
Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job advertisement is in Polish.  The title "Pielęgniarka" translates to "Nurse." The description details responsibilities related to patient interviews, administering contrast agents for MRI and CT scans, and managing adverse reactions. This suggests a role within a diagnostic imaging setting.

2. **Analysis of Provided ISCO Units:**

* **2212 - Specialist medical practitioners:** This is incorrect. The advertisement doesn't mention diagnosis or treatment planning, which are core duties of medical doctors.  Administering contrast agents is typically not a primary physician's role.

* **2221 - Nursing professionals:** This is the most likely match. The title "Nurse," combined with duties involving patient interaction, administering medications (contrast agents), and managing reactions, aligns well with the nursing profession.  The required "kierunkowe wykształcenie" (directional education) implies specialized training, further supporting this classification.

* **2240 - Paramedical practitioners:** While the job involves medical procedures, the description doesn't suggest the autonomy or complexity associated with paramedical practitioners.  The focus is on specific tasks within a diagnostic imaging setting, rather than broader primary care.

* **2269 - Health professionals n.e.c.:** This is a catch-all category and less specific than 2221. Since the job clearly falls under nursing, 2221 is more appropriate.

* **3221 - Nursing associate professionals:** This is less likely. The advertisement implies a level of responsibility beyond basic nursing assistance, such as administering contrast agents and managing reactions.  "Sumienność" (conscientiousness) suggests a higher level of accountability.

* **3252 - Medical records and health information technicians:** This is incorrect. The job is not focused on medical records or information management.

* **3259 - Health associate professionals n.e.c.:** While the job involves health care support, the nursing focus makes 2221 more precise.

* **5321 - Health care assistants:** This is incorrect. The job requires more specialized knowledge and skills than a typical healthcare assistant, particularly in administering contrast agents.

* **5322 - Home-based personal care workers:** This is incorrect. The job is within a clinical setting, not a home-based setting.

* **5329 - Health and personal care support workers n.e.c.:** This is too general.  The specific nursing duties make 2221 a better fit.

3. **Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code:** 2221
**ISCO Title:** Nursing professionals
**Confidence:** 0.9
**Reasoning:** The job title "Pielęgniarka" (Nurse), the described duties (patient interaction, administering contrast agents, managing reactions), and the required education strongly suggest a nursing role.  The level of responsibility appears to be consistent with a professional nurse rather than an associate professional.

**Alternative ISCO Codes:** 3221, 2240, 3259

Job Ad ID: 858475641, Row: 25438, Pred: 1411, 1412, 3434, 4224, 1439, 5151, 1219, 1342, 1322, 5152
Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Hotel Manager." The description emphasizes managing and developing a team, driving brand strategy, maximizing revenue, overseeing daily operations, and having a strong knowledge of food and drink.  This points towards a managerial role within the hospitality industry.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **1411 (Hotel managers):** This is a strong match. The job title and description align perfectly with the definition and tasks of a hotel manager, including directing operations, supervising various hotel activities, managing staff, and handling budgeting.
    * **1219 (Business services and administration managers):** While the ad mentions some administrative tasks, the core responsibilities revolve around hospitality services, not general business administration. This is not a good fit.
    * **1322 (Mining managers):** This is completely irrelevant to the hospitality industry.
    * **1342 (Health services managers):**  Also irrelevant, as the job is not in the healthcare sector.
    * **1412 (Restaurant managers):** Although related to hospitality, the focus is narrower than the hotel manager role.  The advertisement emphasizes overall hotel operations, not just food and beverage service.
    * **1439 (Managers not elsewhere classified):**  While this is a broader category, 1411 (Hotel managers) is a more specific and accurate match.
    * **3434 (Chefs):** This focuses on food preparation, not overall hotel management.
    * **4224 (Hotel receptionists):** This is a clerical role, not a management position.
    * **5151 (Cleaning and housekeeping supervisors):** This is a supervisory role within housekeeping, not hotel management.
    * **5152 (Domestic housekeepers):** This is not applicable to a hotel setting.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    * **ISCO Code:** 1411
    * **ISCO Title:** Hotel managers
    * **Confidence:** 1.0
    * **Reasoning:**  The job title, description, and responsibilities align perfectly with the ISCO definition of a hotel manager. The advertisement explicitly mentions tasks such as overseeing daily operations, managing staff, driving brand strategy, and maximizing revenue, all core responsibilities of a hotel manager.

    * **Alternative ISCO Codes:**  None. The provided 1411 is a perfect match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Job Ad ID: 717015258, Row: 25437, Pred: 9612, 9611, 8332, 9333, 9613, 9313, 9624, 8344, 9312, 9621
Response:
1. The job title is "Refuse Loader."  This immediately points towards ISCO unit 9611 (Garbage collectors), as "Refuse collector" is listed as an example.

2. The job description emphasizes collecting waste/refuse from residential and commercial properties, emptying bins into trucks, and returning bins. These tasks align perfectly with the description of 9611.

3. The required skills are physical fitness, working outdoors, and good communication with the public.  These are consistent with the elementary occupation classification of 9611 and don't suggest the need for specialized driving skills like 8332 (Heavy truck and lorry drivers).

4.  The job ad doesn't mention driving the refuse truck, only loading it.  This distinguishes it from 8332.  The other potential ISCO units are less relevant.  9312 and 9313 relate to construction, 9333 is more general freight handling, 9612 is sorting refuse, 9613 is street sweeping, 9621 is messenger/porter work, and 9624 involves collecting water and firewood.  None of these fit the job description as well as 9611.

ISCO Code: 9611
ISCO Title: Garbage collectors
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description clearly align with the tasks and definition of a Garbage collector (9611).  The job focuses solely on loading refuse, not driving, eliminating 8332.  All other provided ISCO codes are less relevant.
Alternative ISCO Codes: 9333, 9612, 5321 (if driving a small collection vehicle is involved, otherwise not applicable based on current description)

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Experienced Bookkeepers needed," and the description emphasizes responsibilities like A/P, A/R, bank reconciliations, and general ledger maintenance.  The required skills include QuickBooks, Excel, Word, and GAAP knowledge.  The experience requirement is 3-5 years, suggesting a more than entry-level position.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **3313 (Accounting associate professionals):** This is a strong match. The job description aligns with the tasks listed for this unit, including maintaining financial records, verifying transactions, and preparing financial statements.  "Bookkeeper" is explicitly listed as an example occupation.
    * **2411 (Accountants):** While some tasks overlap, this unit implies a higher level of responsibility and expertise than the job ad describes.  The ad emphasizes performing bookkeeping tasks, not planning or advising on accounting systems.
    * **Other provided ISCO units:** The remaining ISCO units (Legal secretaries, Admin secretaries, General office clerks, Data entry clerks, Receptionists, Accounting and bookkeeping clerks, Statistical, finance and insurance clerks, and Payroll clerks) are not relevant to the job advertisement as they do not encompass the core responsibilities and required skills of a bookkeeper.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 3313
ISCO Title: Accounting associate professionals
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job responsibilities and required skills align perfectly with the description of Accounting associate professionals.  The title "Bookkeeper" is explicitly mentioned within this ISCO unit.

Alternative ISCO Codes: 4311, 2411, 4313

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The title "Occupational Therapy Assistant" is a strong indicator of the correct ISCO unit.

2. **Review ISCO 2269 (Health Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified):** This unit explicitly includes "Occupational Therapist" as an example occupation and aligns well with the job description's focus on assessments, adaptations, and equipment prescription to promote independence. The tasks described in the ad, such as assessing for and prescribing adaptations and equipment, fall under the broader description of providing diagnostic, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health services.

3. **Consider ISCO 3255 (Physiotherapy Technicians and Assistants):** While the ad mentions working with Occupational Therapists, the core responsibilities are distinct from physiotherapy.  The focus is not on physical therapies like massage or ultrasound, but on functional assessments and prescribing adaptations/equipment. Therefore, this ISCO unit is less suitable.

4. **Evaluate other ISCO units:** The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant. They focus on different healthcare professions (nursing, dental, etc.) or social work, which do not align with the job description.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2269
ISCO Title: Health Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title explicitly mentions "Occupational Therapy Assistant," and the job description aligns perfectly with the tasks and responsibilities outlined within ISCO 2269, which includes occupational therapists.  The focus on functional assessments, adaptations, and equipment prescription to promote independence falls under the scope of this unit.

Alternative ISCO Codes: 3255, 3412, 5322 (These are provided as alternatives, but 2269 is a very strong match, making these far less likely).

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Estate Agent Senior Sales Negotiator / Lister." The description emphasizes sales, generating new instructions (listings), customer interaction, and negotiation.  The role requires at least one year of experience in Estate Agency.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **3334 - Real estate agents and property managers:** This is the most relevant unit. The job title explicitly mentions "Estate Agent," and the description aligns with the tasks of real estate agents, such as showing properties, negotiating terms, and facilitating sales/leases. The required experience further reinforces this classification.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
    * The job title "Estate Agent" directly corresponds to the ISCO title "Real estate agents and property managers."
    * The job description focuses on sales and negotiation within the real estate context.  Tasks like "generating sales and gaining new instructions" are core responsibilities of real estate agents.
    * The requirement of 1+ years of Estate Agency experience confirms the specialization within real estate.

4. **Final Prediction:**
    ISCO Code: 3334
    ISCO Title: Real estate agents and property managers
    Confidence: 1.0
    Reasoning: The job title and description clearly align with the tasks and responsibilities of a real estate agent, as defined in ISCO unit 3334. The required experience further strengthens this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Qualified Electrician." The description emphasizes installing smart meters, performing remedial works, ensuring safety, customer service, and using mobile technology for reporting.  The required qualifications include a National Craft Cert Level 6 or City & Guilds NVQ Level 4 and at least one year of experience in the commercial/industrial sector.

2. **Compare with ISCO 2151 (Electrical Engineer):** This unit focuses on designing and directing electrical systems and their operation. The job ad is for an electrician performing installations and repairs, not designing systems.  Therefore, this ISCO code is not appropriate.

3. **Compare with ISCO 3113 (Electrical Engineering Technician):** This unit involves technical tasks aiding in research, design, and maintenance of electrical equipment. While closer than 2151, the job ad still focuses on hands-on installation and repair, not the technical assistance described in 3113.

4. **Compare with ISCO 7124 (Insulation Worker):** This unit is not relevant, as it deals with applying insulation materials, not electrical work.

5. **Compare with ISCO 7127 (Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Mechanic):** This unit is also not relevant, focusing on air conditioning and refrigeration systems, not electrical wiring.

6. **Compare with ISCO 7411 (Building and Related Electricians):** This unit's description aligns perfectly with the job advertisement.  The tasks described, such as installing, maintaining, and repairing electrical wiring systems, match the responsibilities in the job ad. The required qualifications and experience also align with this ISCO unit.

7. **Compare with ISCO 7412 (Electrical Mechanics and Fitters):** While related, this unit focuses on fitting and repairing electrical machinery and apparatus, which is broader than the scope of the job ad. The job ad specifically mentions building/residential electrical work.

8. **Compare with ISCO 7413 (Electrical Line Installers and Repairers):** This unit deals with high-voltage transmission and supply cables, which is not mentioned in the job ad.

9. **Compare with ISCO 7421 (Electronics Mechanics and Servicers):** This unit focuses on electronic equipment like commercial machines and instruments, not building electrical systems.

10. **Compare with ISCO 7422 (Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Installers and Servicers):** This unit is focused on telecommunications and data equipment, not building electrical systems.

11. **Compare with ISCO 8212 (Electrical and Electronic Equipment Assemblers):** This unit involves assembling components according to procedures, which is not the primary focus of the job ad.


ISCO Code: 7411
ISCO Title: Building and related electricians
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description and required qualifications align perfectly with the tasks and responsibilities described for Building and related electricians (7411). The job specifically mentions installations within buildings, aligning with the scope of this ISCO unit.
Alternative ISCO Codes: 7412, 3113, 7422

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Associate Lecturer: Criminal Law and the Courts." The description emphasizes teaching criminal law and related topics within the English and Welsh legal system.  The role involves using multimedia, engaging activities, and real case studies.  It also mentions skill development for LLB students and understanding the legal system.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units (in provided order):**
    * **2353 (Other Language Teachers):** This is clearly irrelevant. The job is about law, not language teaching.
    * **2354 (Other Music Teachers):** Equally irrelevant.  No connection to music.
    * **2355 (Other Arts Teachers):**  While law can be considered an art in some contexts, this unit focuses on performance-based arts.  Not a good fit.
    * **2359 (Other Teaching Professionals):** This is a closer match. The job involves teaching, and it's not language, music, or arts-focused.  However, the examples provided (literacy tutor, mathematics coach, school counsellor) don't align well with a law lecturer at a university level.
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This focuses on practicing law, not teaching it. While an associate lecturer might have a legal background, their primary role in this ad is teaching.
    * **2612 (Judges):**  Completely irrelevant. The job is not about presiding over legal proceedings.
    * **2619 (Other Legal Professionals):**  This is also focused on legal practice, not teaching.
    * **3342 (Legal Secretaries):**  This is a support role, not a teaching role.  Irrelevant.
    * **3411 (Legal and Related Associate Professionals):**  Again, this is a support role, not a teaching position.
    * **3412 (Social Work Associate Professionals):**  No relevance to law or teaching law.

3. **Consider Alternative ISCO Units:** Since none of the provided ISCO units are a perfect match, we need to consider alternatives.  The key aspects of the job are *higher education teaching* and *law*.

4. **Alternative ISCO Suggestions:**
    * **2310 (University and Higher Education Teachers):** This is the most appropriate ISCO unit. It encompasses teaching at the university level, which aligns perfectly with the job description.
    * **2421 (Legal Professionals):** While 2310 is a better fit due to the teaching focus, this could be a secondary option if the institution considers the legal expertise as the primary aspect.
    * **2320 (Vocational Education Teachers):**  If the program is considered vocational training rather than higher education, this could be a relevant option. However, given the mention of LLB (Bachelor of Laws), 2310 remains the most likely.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2310
ISCO Title: University and Higher Education Teachers
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: The advertisement describes a teaching role at a university level, focusing on law.  This aligns directly with the scope of ISCO 2310.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The Ambulance Care Assistant transports non-urgent patients to and from healthcare facilities and private residences.  They provide care for frail patients or those needing specialist assistance.  The job requires experience in caring for people, customer service skills, communication skills, flexibility, and a driver's license.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**

* **3221 - Nursing Associate Professionals:** This unit focuses on providing basic nursing and personal care under the supervision of health professionals. While the Ambulance Care Assistant provides care, it's primarily related to transport and assistance, not nursing tasks like administering medications or wound care.  Therefore, this ISCO unit is not the best fit.

* **3222 - Midwifery Associate Professionals:** This unit is clearly irrelevant, as it deals with pregnancy and childbirth.

* **3230 - Traditional and Complementary Medicine Associate Professionals:** This unit is also irrelevant, focusing on traditional healing practices.

* **3256 - Medical Assistants:** This unit involves clinical and administrative tasks under the supervision of a medical practitioner.  While the Ambulance Care Assistant works within the healthcare system, their role is not directly assisting medical practitioners in clinical settings. Thus, this unit is not suitable.

* **3259 - Health Associate Professionals not elsewhere classified:** This is a broader category. While it could potentially encompass the Ambulance Care Assistant, the examples provided (HIV counsellor, family planning counsellor) don't align well with the job description.  We'll keep this as a possibility but continue searching.

* **3412 - Social Work Associate Professionals:** This unit focuses on social assistance and community services. The Ambulance Care Assistant's role is not related to social work.

* **5311 - Child Care Workers:** This unit is irrelevant, as the job is about transporting patients, not caring for children.

* **5321 - Health Care Assistants:** This unit involves providing personal care and assistance with daily living activities in healthcare settings under the supervision of health professionals.  This is closer to the Ambulance Care Assistant's role, but the focus is on in-facility care, not transportation.

* **5322 - Home-based Personal Care Workers:**  This unit is also focused on personal care and assistance, but in private homes.  Again, the transportation aspect is missing.

* **5329 - Health and Personal Care Support Workers not elsewhere classified:** This unit includes roles like dental aides, hospital orderlies, and medical imaging assistants.  While it's a broad category, the examples provided don't align well with the Ambulance Care Assistant's primary responsibilities.

3. **Consider Alternatives:**  Since none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match, consider alternatives:

* **5321 - Health Care Assistants:** This remains the closest match among the provided options, as it involves patient care in a healthcare context.

* **7533 - Ambulance Workers:** This unit directly relates to ambulance services and likely encompasses the described role.

* **5322 - Home-based Personal Care Workers:** While not ideal, this unit could be considered if the transportation aspect is viewed as facilitating home-based care.


**ISCO Code (unit): 5321**
**ISCO Title: Health Care Assistants**
**Confidence: 0.6**
**Reasoning:**  While the job description emphasizes patient transportation, the role involves providing care and assistance to patients, aligning with the core duties of a Health Care Assistant.  The job occurs within the healthcare system and involves working with medical professionals, further supporting this classification.  However, the lack of explicit mention of direct supervision by health professionals slightly lowers the confidence.

Response:
The job advertisement provides extremely limited information, only providing a job title "Tehnologs" which translates to "Technologist".  This makes accurate ISCO unit classification difficult.  Let's analyze the provided options:

1. **2529 - Database and Network Professionals not elsewhere classified:**  While "Technologist" could potentially work in IT, there's no information in the advertisement to suggest this specific area.

2. **3119 - Physical and Engineering Science Technicians not elsewhere classified:**  "Technologist" could also be a technician role, but again, the advertisement lacks details to confirm this.

3. **3139 - Process Control Technicians not elsewhere classified:**  This is less likely given the general nature of the title "Technologist."

4. **3141 - Life Science Technicians (excluding medical):**  Unlikely, given the lack of life science context.

5. **3143 - Forestry Technicians:**  Unlikely, given the lack of forestry context.

6. **3433 - Gallery, museum and library technicians:**  Highly unlikely given the technical connotation of "Technologist."

7. **3511 - Information and communications technology operations technicians:**  Possible, but no more likely than other technical roles due to the lack of information.

8. **3522 - Telecommunications engineering technicians:**  Possible, but no more likely than other technical roles due to the lack of information.

9. **7321 - Pre-press technicians:**  Less likely, given the general nature of the title "Technologist."

10. **7422 - Information and communications technology (ICT) installers and servicers:** Possible, but no more likely than other technical roles due to the lack of information.

Since the advertisement provides insufficient information, none of the provided ISCO units can be confidently assigned.

ISCO Code (unit): 3119
ISCO Title: Physical and Engineering Science Technicians not elsewhere classified

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The job title is "Medical Secretary - Band 3 Dermatology". This immediately suggests a connection to medical support occupations.

2. **Review the job description:** The description emphasizes tasks such as typing correspondence, booking appointments, managing patient records, and other administrative duties within a dermatology department.  This aligns with secretarial and administrative tasks within a healthcare setting.

3. **Compare with ISCO descriptions:**
    * **3251 (Dental assistants and therapists):** This is clearly not a match, as the job is in dermatology, not dentistry.
    * **3252 (Medical records and health information technicians):** While there is some overlap in record-keeping, this ISCO unit focuses on developing and maintaining health record systems, not the day-to-day secretarial tasks described in the ad.
    * **3256 (Medical assistants):** This involves direct patient care under supervision, which is not mentioned in the job ad. The focus is on administrative support, not clinical assistance.
    * **3341 (Office supervisors):**  While the ad mentions supervising a Band 2 clerical assistant, the primary role is not supervisory.  The main duties are secretarial.
    * **3342 (Legal secretaries):**  This is not relevant, as the job is in a medical, not legal, setting.
    * **3343 (Administrative and executive secretaries):** This is a closer match, but lacks the specific medical context. The job ad emphasizes working within a dermatology department, requiring familiarity with medical terminology and procedures.
    * **3344 (Medical secretaries):** This is the **best match**. The description aligns perfectly with the tasks and responsibilities in the job ad, including managing medical correspondence, patient records, appointments, and other administrative duties within a healthcare setting.
    * **4110 (General office clerks):** This is too general and lacks the specific medical context. The job requires specialized knowledge of medical terminology and procedures.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Graphic Designer." The description emphasizes creative design for various applications, including logo design, branding, website design, social media content, print materials, and even animation and editing. This suggests a role focused on visual communication across different media.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2163 - Product and garment designers:** While the job ad mentions "product branding," the core responsibilities are not about designing physical products for manufacture. This ISCO unit is not a good fit.
    * **2166 - Graphic and multimedia designers:** This is a strong match. The job title aligns perfectly, and the description covers many of the tasks listed in the ISCO unit definition, such as creating graphics, animation, website design, and working with various media.
    * **2513 - Web and multimedia development professionals:** While website design is mentioned in the job ad, the focus is more on the visual design aspect than the technical development.

    * **2651 - Visual artists:** This unit focuses on fine arts like sculpting, painting, and drawing.  The graphic design role in the ad is commercially oriented, making this ISCO unit unsuitable.
    * **3432 - Interior designers and decorators:** Although the ad mentions "Interior, Signage and CAD design," it's within the context of branding and visual communication, not interior design as a primary function.  This ISCO unit is not appropriate.
    * **5141 - Hairdressers:**  Completely irrelevant to the job ad.
    * **5142 - Beauticians and related workers:**  Completely irrelevant to the job ad.
    * **7313 - Jewellery and precious metal workers:**  Completely irrelevant to the job ad.
    * **7316 - Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers:** While signage is mentioned, the job is primarily about graphic design, not the physical creation of signs.  This ISCO unit is not a good fit.
    * **7321 - Pre-press technicians:** This unit focuses on preparing materials for printing, which is only a small part of the advertised role.  This ISCO unit is not appropriate.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2166
ISCO Title: Graphic and multimedia designers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description strongly align with the definition and tasks of a graphic and multimedia designer, encompassing various visual communication aspects across different media.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None. The primary prediction has high confidence, and the other provided options are not suitable.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and potential ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title translates to "Interior Decorator / Living Space Designer". The description emphasizes customer interaction, sales, design based on client needs, technical knowledge of products, and project follow-up through to completion.  This suggests a role that combines design with sales and project management.

2. **Analysis of Provided ISCO Units:**

* **2161 (Building Architect):** While the title mentions "architect," the job description focuses on interior spaces within an existing showroom context.  The tasks described in the ad do not involve the structural design and planning elements typical of a building architect.  This ISCO unit is not a good fit.

* **2162 (Landscape Architect):** This is clearly irrelevant, as the job deals with interior spaces, not exterior landscapes.

* **2163 (Product and Garment Designer):**  Although the job involves working with products (kitchen elements), the focus is on designing spaces using these products, not on designing the products themselves. This ISCO unit is not suitable.

* **2166 (Graphic and Multimedia Designer):** This is not relevant, as the job is about physical spaces, not visual and audio-visual content.

* **2651 (Visual Artist):** This is also irrelevant. The job is about design and sales within a commercial context, not creating fine art.

* **3432 (Interior Designers and Decorators):** This ISCO unit is the closest match. The job description aligns with many of the tasks listed, such as consulting with clients, formulating design concepts, preparing sketches and plans, selecting materials and products, and coordinating construction and decoration. The sales and project management aspects are not explicitly mentioned in the ISCO description but are common in interior design roles, especially in retail settings.

* **5242 (Sales Demonstrators):** While the job involves demonstrating products and interacting with customers, the primary focus is on design and project management.  This ISCO unit underrepresents the design aspect of the role.

* **7115 (Painters and related workers):** This is not relevant, as the job does not involve painting or wallpapering.

* **7316 (Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers):** This is also irrelevant, as the job does not involve these specific decorative skills.

3. **Conclusion:**

ISCO Code: 3432
ISCO Title: Interior designers and decorators
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: The job description strongly aligns with the tasks of an interior designer/decorator, particularly in a retail setting. The focus on client consultation, design concept creation, material selection, and project oversight fits this ISCO unit well.  While the sales aspect is not explicitly mentioned in the ISCO description, it's a common component of such roles, especially when working directly with clients in a showroom.

    * **2352 - Special Needs Teachers:**  There is no mention of special needs education in the advertisement.
    * **2353 - Other Language Teachers:** While the ad specifies a native English speaker, the context is within a primary school setting, teaching general subjects, not solely English as a second language.
    * **2354 - Other Music Teachers:**  No mention of music teaching in the ad.
    * **2355 - Other Arts Teachers:** No mention of arts teaching in the ad.
    * **2359 - Other Teaching Professionals:** This is less specific than 2341 and doesn't capture the core function of the role as well.
    * **5312 - Teachers' Aides:** This is not a match. The ad clearly seeks a qualified teacher, not an assistant.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2341
ISCO Title: Primary School Teachers
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: The job title, description, required experience, and focus on primary and infant levels strongly align with the ISCO definition of a Primary School Teacher.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Greek speaking Nanny in Westminster." The description emphasizes childcare duties, language development (Greek), and household tasks related to the children.

2. **Review ISCO 5311 (Child care workers):** This unit's description and tasks closely align with the advertisement.  The tasks listed, such as assisting with daily routines, playing, managing behavior, and observing activities, are all mentioned in the job description. The "Nanny" title is explicitly listed as a similar job title for this ISCO unit.

3. **Consider ISCO 2342 (Early childhood educators):** While some tasks overlap with the nanny role (e.g., promoting language development, organizing activities), the focus of this ISCO unit is on *educational* activities in a *pre-school* setting. The advertisement doesn't mention a formal educational setting or curriculum development, which are key aspects of early childhood education. Therefore, this is less suitable than 5311.

4. **Evaluate other ISCO units:** The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant.  They focus on language teaching (2353), nursing (3221), midwifery (3222), housekeeping (5152), teaching assistance (5312), healthcare assistance (5321), home-based personal care (5322), and domestic cleaning (9111). None of these align with the core responsibilities described in the advertisement.

ISCO Code: 5311
ISCO Title: Child care workers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description focuses on childcare duties, including daily routines, play, and managing children's behavior. The title "Nanny" is explicitly mentioned in the ISCO 5311 description.  While the requirement to speak Greek is specific, it falls within the broader scope of a child care worker's role in promoting language development.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title "Steel Fabricator/Welder" clearly indicates the primary tasks involve fabricating and welding steel. The description emphasizes MIG welding on various thicknesses of steel plate for container manufacturing.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO descriptions and titles:**
    * **7212 Welders and flame cutters:** This unit's description and tasks closely align with the job ad, mentioning welding metal parts using electric arc and other methods. The inclusion of "Welder" in the job title and the description's focus on welding make this a strong match.
    * **7213 Sheet metal workers:** While the job involves working with metal, the focus is on fabrication and welding rather than the broader sheet metal work described in this unit (e.g., making boilers, tanks, vehicle parts).  This is less relevant than 7212.
    * **7214 Structural metal preparers and erectors:** This unit focuses on assembling and erecting structural metal frames, which doesn't align with the container manufacturing described in the job ad.
    * **7221 Blacksmiths, hammersmiths and forging press workers:**  This unit involves forging and shaping metal using hammers and presses, which is not the primary function described in the job ad.
    * **7223 Metal working machine tool setters and operators:** While the job might involve some machine operation, the primary focus is on welding and fabrication, not setting and operating various machine tools.
    * **7119 Building frame and related trades workers not elsewhere classified:** This unit is completely unrelated to the job ad, covering tasks like scaffolding and demolition.
    * **7211 Metal moulders and coremakers:** This unit focuses on creating moulds for casting metal, not welding and fabricating containers.
    * **8121 Metal processing plant operators:** This unit involves operating and maintaining single-function machinery for metal processing, which is too broad and doesn't specifically address welding and fabrication.
    * **3135 Metal production process controllers:** This unit focuses on controlling and monitoring metal production processes, not hands-on fabrication and welding.
    * **9329 Manufacturing labourers not elsewhere classified:** This unit covers simple and routine manual tasks in manufacturing, which doesn't match the skilled welding and fabrication required in the job ad.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires experience in fabricating and MIG welding, directly aligning with the skills of a welder.

4. **Consider major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The most relevant ISCO units fall under Major Group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers), specifically Sub-major Group 72 (Metal, Machinery and Related Trades Workers). This further supports the selection of a unit within this group.

ISCO Code: 7212
ISCO Title: Welders and flame cutters
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title explicitly mentions "Welder," and the description focuses on MIG welding for container manufacturing, directly aligning with the tasks and skills described in ISCO unit 7212.

1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Junior Accountant with French". The description emphasizes accounting tasks such as working with accounting documents, month/year closing, reconciliations, and contact with international clients.  This aligns strongly with accounting-related ISCO units.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The tasks described in the ad (accurate and timely service of accounting processes, working with accounting documents, participation in the closing of the month/year, accounts reconciliations) fall under the scope of accounting and bookkeeping activities.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The job requires an economics/finance/taxes educational background, French and English language skills, and Excel proficiency. While accounting experience is preferred, it's not required, suggesting an entry-level or junior role.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The most relevant ISCO units provided fall under Major Group 2 (Professionals) and Major Group 3 (Technicians and Associate Professionals), specifically within the sub-majors related to Business and Administration.

5. **Step-by-step reasoning:**
    * **ISCO 2411 (Accountants):** While the job title mentions "Accountant," the lack of required experience and the emphasis on basic accounting tasks suggest this might be too senior a classification.
    * **ISCO 3313 (Accounting associate professionals):** This unit's description of maintaining financial records, verifying accuracy, and preparing reports aligns well with the job ad's tasks. The "junior" nature of the role and the "nice-to-have" experience requirement also fit the associate professional level.
    * **Other ISCO units:** The remaining ISCO units (statistical, data entry, debt collection, payroll, personnel) are not relevant to the core accounting duties described in the job ad.

ISCO Code: 3313
ISCO Title: Accounting associate professionals
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: The job description focuses on basic accounting tasks, aligns with the responsibilities of an accounting associate professional, and explicitly mentions a junior role, making ISCO 3313 the most appropriate classification.

* **2211 - Generalist medical practitioners:** This is not a match. The job ad doesn't mention diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of illnesses.  It doesn't require a medical doctor.
* **2212 - Specialist medical practitioners:** This is not a match for the same reasons as 2211.
* **2240 - Paramedical practitioners:** This is not a match. The job ad doesn't mention providing medical services, even under supervision.
* **2250 - Veterinarians:** This is not a match. The job ad clearly relates to human health, not animal health.
* **2269 - Health professionals (n.e.c.):**  While closer than previous options, this isn't a perfect fit. The ad doesn't mention specific therapeutic treatments or rehabilitative services.
* **2433 - Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT):** This is the closest match. The job title "Medical Visitor" strongly suggests a sales role, and the description mentions working with a "medical group," implying interaction with medical professionals to promote products or services.
* **3259 - Health associate professionals (n.e.c.):** This is not a match.  The job ad doesn't mention counseling, administering therapeutic care, or other tasks listed in this unit.
* **3344 - Medical secretaries:** This is not a match. The job ad doesn't mention administrative or secretarial tasks.
* **4229 - Client information workers (n.e.c.):** This is not a match. The job ad doesn't involve gathering information from clients for service eligibility.

3. **Alternative ISCO Units:**  Given that none of the provided ISCO units are a perfect fit, here are three alternative suggestions:

* **5163 - Pharmaceutical and medical goods dispensers:**  While not explicitly stated, a medical visitor might be involved in distributing samples or providing information about pharmaceutical products.
* **3322 - Sales representatives (wholesale and retail trade, except ICT):** This is a broader sales category and could be relevant if the medical visitor is selling medical devices or other non-pharmaceutical products.
* **5132 - Nursing associate professionals:**  This is a less likely fit, but possible if the medical visitor provides support services to healthcare professionals, although the advertisement lacks details to confirm this.


**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): **2433**
ISCO Title: **Technical and medical sales professionals (excluding ICT)**
Confidence: **0.8**
Reasoning: The job title "Medical Visitor" strongly suggests a sales/marketing role within the medical/pharmaceutical field. The job description mentions prior experience in the same role and specifies a regional area of operation, further supporting this classification.

Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): **5163, 3322, 5132**

Job Ad ID: 850504588, Row: 25412, Pred: 1345, 2330, 2359, 2341, 2351, 2310, 2353, 2120, 3314, 2354
Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:**
The job title translates to "Mathematics Teacher," and the description indicates the teacher will work at a tutoring center (Φροντιστήριο ΙΔΕΟΡΑΜΑ) with middle school and high school students, covering math, physics, chemistry, and biology.  The requirement is a degree in one of those subjects. This suggests a teaching role focused on secondary education, potentially outside the formal school system.

2. **Analysis of Provided ISCO Units:**

* **2330 - Secondary Education Teachers:** This is a strong initial candidate. The ad mentions teaching secondary-level students (Γυμνασίου - middle school, Λυκείου - high school), and the subjects align with general secondary education. However, the setting is a private tutoring center, not a formal secondary school.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Porter" at a hotel. The description emphasizes guest interaction, managing the flow of people, assisting with queries, parking cars, directing traffic, and representing the hotel's values.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **9621 - Messengers, package deliverers and luggage porters:** This unit explicitly includes "Hotel porter" and "Luggage porter" in its examples and aligns well with the described tasks of assisting guests with luggage and managing the hotel entrance.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The job title is "Pastry Chef."  This directly matches one of the example occupations and similar job titles listed under ISCO 3434: Chefs.

2. **Analyze the job description:** The description emphasizes creating menus, managing operations related to pastry production, maintaining quality standards, and ensuring guest satisfaction.  These responsibilities align with the tasks described for Chefs (ISCO 3434), such as designing menus, creating dishes, and overseeing the preparation and cooking of meals.  The requirement of a degree in Hospitality/Institute of Culinary Arts further supports this classification.

3. **Analyze required skills and qualifications:** The advertisement lists skills like excellent communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and the ability to perform under pressure. While these are transferable skills, they are expected of a chef managing a section of a kitchen.  The specific requirement of 2+ years of experience in a similar position in a 5-star or luxury hotel further points towards a skilled professional role, aligning with the skill level assigned to ISCO 3434.

4. **Analyze ISCO categories:** ISCO 3434 falls under Major group 3 (Technicians and Associate Professionals), which is appropriate given the specialized knowledge and skills required for a pastry chef. The sub-major group 34 (Legal, Social, Cultural and Related Associate Professionals) is a broader category, but the unit group 3434 (Chefs) accurately captures the specific occupation.

5. **Comparison with other potential ISCO units:** While some tasks might overlap with Cooks (ISCO 5120), the level of responsibility, menu planning, and management involved in this role clearly distinguishes it and points towards the higher skill level of a Chef.  The other ISCO units are even less relevant, focusing on management (1411 and 1412), front desk duties (4224), or less skilled food preparation roles (9411 and 9412).

ISCO Code: 3434
ISCO Title: Chefs
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, required experience, degree requirement, and described responsibilities closely align with the definition and tasks of a Chef as described in ISCO 3434.  The focus on menu creation, quality control, and managing pastry operations distinguishes this role from less skilled cooking occupations.

    * **2413 - Financial Analysts:** This is clearly not relevant, as it deals with financial investments.
    * **2421 - Management and Organization Analysts:**  This focuses on organizational efficiency and problem-solving, not specifically health and safety.
    * **2422 - Policy Administration Professionals:** While policy development is mentioned in the job ad, it's a small part of the overall responsibilities. The primary focus is on implementing existing policies, not creating new ones.
    * **2511 - Systems Analysts (IT):**  Not relevant, as the job is not focused on IT systems.
    * **3252 - Medical Records and Health Information Technicians:** This is focused on medical records management, not workplace safety.
    * **3257 - Environmental and occupational health inspectors and associates:** This unit involves inspecting workplaces for safety compliance, which is closer to the advertised role than 2263.  The job ad mentions inspections and audits as part of the responsibilities.
    * **3259 - Health Associate Professionals (n.e.c.):** This is a catch-all category and doesn't specifically address occupational health and safety.
    * **5321 - Health Care Assistants:** This involves direct patient care, which is not the focus of the advertised role.

3. **Compare responsibilities and required skills:** The job ad emphasizes tasks like implementing safety plans, conducting inspections, managing data, and ensuring compliance.  These align well with the tasks described in ISCO 3257. The required skills, such as knowledge of health and safety legislation, NEBOSH certification, and experience in a similar role, further support this classification.

4. **Consider the ISCO hierarchy:**  The job requires a good understanding of regulations and the ability to analyze data and implement plans. This suggests a technician or associate professional level (Major Group 3) rather than a professional level (Major Group 2).

ISCO Code (unit): 3257
ISCO Title: Environmental and occupational health inspectors and associates
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: The job responsibilities heavily focus on implementing health and safety procedures, conducting inspections, and ensuring compliance, aligning with the description of this ISCO unit. The required qualifications and skills further support this classification.

1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job advertisement is for a "Head of Legal" at TheFork, a subsidiary of TripAdvisor.  The role involves overseeing all legal matters globally, advising the executive team, managing a legal team, and handling various legal areas like commercial transactions, M&A, employment law, regulatory matters, intellectual property, and compliance.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is a strong match. The job description emphasizes providing legal counsel, handling various legal areas, and managing a legal team.  The required experience as a qualified attorney further reinforces this.
    * **2619 (Legal Professionals not elsewhere classified):** While the role involves legal functions, it goes beyond the scope described in this unit. The Head of Legal has managerial responsibilities and a broader range of expertise than typically found in this category.
    * **3342 (Legal Secretaries):** This is not a match. The Head of Legal role is a senior management position requiring extensive legal expertise and leadership, whereas legal secretaries provide support functions.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** This is also not a match.  The Head of Legal role is a leadership position with strategic responsibilities, while this unit describes support roles.
    * **1111 (Legislators):** This is not a match. The role is within a company, focusing on corporate legal matters, not policymaking or legislation.
    * **1411 (Hotel Managers):** Not a match. The role is unrelated to hotel management.
    * **1412 (Restaurant Managers):** Not a match. The role is unrelated to restaurant management.
    * **3434 (Chefs):** Not a match. The role is unrelated to culinary arts.
    * **5120 (Cooks):** Not a match. The role is unrelated to culinary arts.
    * **5131 (Waiters):** Not a match. The role is unrelated to food service.

3. **Determine the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit:** Based on the analysis, ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers) is the most appropriate match.

ISCO Code: 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job responsibilities align strongly with the description of Lawyers, including providing legal counsel, handling diverse legal areas, and managing a legal team. The required qualifications and experience as a qualified attorney further support this classification.
Alternative ISCO Codes: 1210, 2422, 2619

Job Ad ID: 780643340, Row: 25405, Pred: 5414, 5413, 5419, 110, 210, 5153, 5412, 310, 5113, 4416
Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Summary:** The job advertisement is for Armed Security Guards (Guardie Giurate) at Sicuritalia SPA in Lecco, Italy.  They are looking for personnel to work in armed surveillance. Requirements include being an EU citizen, having a driver's license, computer skills, a firearms license, and the "Guardia Particolare Giurata" decree (which is the Italian license for armed security guards).  Prior military or law enforcement experience is a plus.

2. **ISCO 110 (Commissioned Armed Forces Officers):** This is incorrect. The advertisement explicitly targets security guards for a private company, not commissioned officers in the armed forces.

3. **ISCO 210 (Non-commissioned Armed Forces Officers):** This is also incorrect for the same reason as above.  The job is a civilian role, not within the armed forces.

4. **ISCO 310 (Armed Forces Occupations, Other Ranks):**  Again, incorrect. This refers to enlisted personnel in the military, not civilian security guards.

5. **ISCO 4416 (Personnel clerks):** This is incorrect. The job duties are entirely different. Personnel clerks handle administrative HR tasks, not security.

6. **ISCO 5113 (Travel guides):** This is incorrect.  The job has nothing to do with tourism or guiding tours.

7. **ISCO 5153 (Building caretakers):** While caretakers sometimes have security responsibilities, this is not the primary focus of the advertised role.  The core duties of a building caretaker revolve around maintenance and tenant services.

8. **ISCO 5412 (Police officers):** This is incorrect. While related to security, police officers are public servants with powers of arrest and law enforcement responsibilities beyond those of a private security guard.

9. **ISCO 5413 (Prison guards):** This is incorrect.  Prison guards work within correctional facilities, a very different context from private security.

10. **ISCO 5414 (Security guards):** This is the **correct** ISCO unit. The job description closely aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of a security guard: patrolling premises, controlling access, maintaining order, and responding to disturbances. The requirement for a firearms license further reinforces this classification.

11. **ISCO 5419 (Other Protective Services Workers):** While plausible, this is too general. ISCO 5414 is a more specific and accurate match.


**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 5414
ISCO Title: Security guards
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description directly matches the tasks and responsibilities of a security guard, including patrolling, access control, and maintaining order. The mention of "vigilanza armata" (armed surveillance) and the requirement for firearms licenses further solidifies this classification.

Job Ad ID: 868555189, Row: 25404, Pred: 7115, 7522, 7523, 7111, 7317, 7119, 7534, 7521, 9622, 7536
Response:
1. **Analyze ISCO 7115 (Carpenters and Joiners):** This unit's description of cutting, shaping, assembling, erecting, maintaining, and repairing various wooden structures and fittings closely aligns with the job advertisement for a Bench Joiner.  The tasks listed, such as making and repairing woodwork and fitting internal and external fixtures, are directly relevant to the advertised role. The job title "Joiner" is explicitly mentioned as an example occupation within this ISCO unit.

2. **Analyze ISCO 7111 (House Builders):** While involving woodwork, house building is a broader category. The Bench Joiner role focuses on specific joinery tasks within a workshop setting, producing windows, doors, etc., rather than erecting entire houses or managing subcontractors.  Therefore, this ISCO unit is less suitable.

3. **Analyze ISCO 7119 (Building Frame and Related Trades Workers):** This unit encompasses specialized roles like steeplejacks, scaffolders, and demolition workers, which are not relevant to the Bench Joiner position.

4. **Analyze ISCO 7317 (Handicraft Workers in Wood):** This unit focuses on traditional techniques, decorative arts, and producing smaller-scale items. The Bench Joiner role at the Sash Restoration Co. involves producing larger-scale items like windows and doors, indicating a focus on construction rather than handicrafts.

5. **Analyze ISCO 7521 (Wood Treaters):** This unit deals with the treatment and preservation of wood, not the construction of joinery products. Thus, it's not a good fit.

6. **Analyze ISCO 7522 (Cabinet-Makers):** While both cabinet-makers and joiners work with wood, cabinet making tends to focus on furniture and smaller items, often with more intricate decorative work. The Bench Joiner role emphasizes structural joinery for windows and doors, making ISCO 7115 a closer match.

7. **Analyze ISCO 7523 (Woodworking Machine Tool Setters and Operators):**  This unit focuses on operating woodworking machinery. While a Bench Joiner might use such machinery, the advertisement emphasizes skilled joinery work, suggesting a broader skillset than just machine operation.

8. **Analyze ISCO 7534 (Upholsterers):** This unit is clearly unrelated to the Bench Joiner advertisement.

9. **Analyze ISCO 7536 (Shoemakers):** This unit is also clearly unrelated to the Bench Joiner advertisement.

10. **Analyze ISCO 9622 (Odd-job Persons):** This unit involves general maintenance and simple repairs, lacking the specialized skills and experience required for a Bench Joiner.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 7115
ISCO Title: Carpenters and Joiners
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description explicitly mentions "Joiner" and details tasks such as producing windows and doors, which align perfectly with the ISCO 7115 description of cutting, shaping, and assembling wooden structures and fittings. The required experience in joinery further strengthens this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Senior Software Development Engineer." The description emphasizes hands-on software development skills in Java, microservices, Spring, SQL, NoSQL databases, testing frameworks, cloud technologies, CI/CD, and performance optimization.  "Senior" implies a level of experience and autonomy.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2512 - Software Developers:** This is a strong match. The job description aligns with the tasks of researching, designing, developing, and testing software. The required skills like Java, Spring, and cloud technologies fall under this unit. The "Senior" title suggests a level of expertise consistent with 2512.
    * **2514 - Applications Programmers:** While the job involves programming, the focus is broader than just writing code. The responsibilities include design, architecture, and working with cloud technologies, which are more aligned with a software developer role.
    * **2513 - Web and Multimedia Development Professionals:**  While full-stack experience with Angular is mentioned as an advantage, the core responsibilities are not focused on web or multimedia development.
    * **2519 - Software and Applications Developers and Analysts n.e.c.:** This is a less specific category. While the job could potentially fall under this category, 2512 is a more precise match.
    * **2511 - Systems Analysts:** The job description doesn't emphasize systems analysis tasks like evaluating client IT requirements or developing proposals to improve systems. The focus is on software development.
    * **2424 - Training and Staff Development Professionals:** This is not relevant to the job advertisement.
    * **2413 - Financial Analysts:**  The job is within a financial organization, but the role itself is not related to financial analysis.
    * **2412 - Financial and Investment Advisers:** Not relevant to the job advertisement.
    * **1223 - Research and Development Managers:** The job involves software development, not research and development in a managerial capacity.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    ISCO Code: 2512
    ISCO Title: Software Developers
    Confidence: 1.0
    Reasoning: The job description clearly focuses on software development tasks, requiring expertise in Java, microservices, cloud technologies, and related skills. The "Senior" title indicates a level of experience and responsibility consistent with a Software Developer role.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Summary:** The job advertisement is for a Cashier position in Hoeilaart, Belgium.  The main tasks involve operating the cash register, assisting customers, and helping out where needed in the store.  Experience is preferred, but not required. Key requirements include customer service skills, flexibility, willingness to work Saturdays, and fluency in Dutch (with French as a plus).

2. **Analysis of Provided ISCO Units:**

* **5230 - Cashiers and Ticket Clerks:** This is the most relevant unit. The job description explicitly mentions "Bedienen van de kassa" (Operating the cash register), which is the core task of a cashier.  The other duties, such as customer service, also align with this ISCO unit.

* **Other Provided ISCO Units:** None of the other provided ISCO units are a good fit.  They involve different skill sets, responsibilities, and levels of autonomy.  For example, 5211 (Stall and Market Salespersons) and 5221 (Shopkeepers) involve managing inventory and pricing, which are not mentioned in the job ad. 5222 (Shop supervisors) involves supervising staff, which is not part of this cashier role. 5223 (Shop sales assistants) has a broader scope than just operating a cash register. 5246 (Food service counter attendants) involves food preparation, which is not mentioned.  9334 (Shelf fillers), 9412 (Kitchen helpers), and 9629 (Other elementary workers) are all lower-skilled roles that don't match the cashier's responsibilities.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 5230
ISCO Title: Cashiers and Ticket Clerks
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description focuses on operating a cash register and providing customer service, which are the primary duties of this ISCO unit.  The required skills and qualifications also align with this role.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Solicitor – Real Estate/Projects." The description emphasizes legal work within real estate and project development, including advising clients, drafting legal documents, managing transactions, and handling land registration formalities.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is a strong match. The job title "Solicitor" is explicitly listed as an example occupation. The description aligns with the tasks of a lawyer specializing in real estate, such as advising clients, drafting legal documents, and negotiating agreements.
    * **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):** This is not a match. The job responsibilities are focused on legal work, not human resources or career guidance.
    * **2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** While the job involves legal work, the specific tasks and title "Solicitor" are clearly within the scope of 2611 (Lawyers).  2619 is for legal professionals *not* classified elsewhere, making 2611 a better fit.
    * **3315 (Valuers and loss assessors):** This is not a match. The job is not about valuing property or assessing losses.
    * **3333 (Employment agents and contractors):** This is not a match. The job is not about matching jobseekers with vacancies.
    * **3334 (Real estate agents and property managers):** While the job involves real estate, the focus is on the *legal* aspects, not sales, rentals, or property management.
    * **3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified):** This is not a match. The job's core functions are legal, not general business services.
    * **3342 (Legal secretaries):** This is not a match. The job requires a qualified solicitor to perform legal work, not secretarial or administrative support.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** While related to law, this unit covers support roles like paralegals and law clerks. The advertisement specifies a solicitor with PQE (Post-Qualified Experience), indicating a fully qualified lawyer, not a support role.  

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title "Solicitor" and the described responsibilities clearly fall within the scope of ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers), specifically those specializing in real estate law.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None. The primary prediction (2611 - Lawyers) is a perfect fit, making alternative suggestions unnecessary and inaccurate.

Job Ad ID: 862891293, Row: 25400, Pred: 4313, 2423, 4416, 3333, 3412, 2422, 4419, 2411, 3341, 1219
Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Payroll Specialist IPASS." The description emphasizes preparing and processing a large monthly payroll, administering the Time Management System, handling payroll calculations and deductions, managing employee benefits, and assisting with month-end reporting.  The required qualifications include the IPASS qualification and at least two years of experience in high-volume Irish payroll.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**

* **ISCO 4313: Payroll Clerks:** This is the most relevant unit based on the job title and description. The tasks described in the ISCO unit closely match the responsibilities in the advertisement, such as maintaining attendance records, calculating pay, preparing statements of earnings, and processing payments. The requirement of two years of experience suggests a higher skill level than a typical clerk, but the core duties align with this category.

* **Other Provided ISCO Units:** The other ISCO units provided are less relevant. ISCO 3341 (Office Supervisors) involves supervising clerical staff, which is not a primary duty in the advertisement. ISCO 3412 (Social Work Associate Professionals), ISCO 4416 (Other Clerical Support Workers), ISCO 4419 (Other Clerical Support Workers), ISCO 3333 (Employment Agents and Contractors), ISCO 2423 (Personnel and Careers Professionals), ISCO 2422 (Policy Administration Professionals), ISCO 2411 (Accountants), and ISCO 1219 (Business Services and Administration Managers) are all significantly different in terms of their core responsibilities and required skills.

3. **Consider IPASS Qualification:** The advertisement specifically mentions the IPASS qualification.  The Irish Payroll Association (IPASS) offers qualifications that demonstrate a higher level of payroll expertise than a typical clerk. This suggests the role requires more specialized knowledge and responsibility.

4. **Final Determination:** While ISCO 4313 is the closest match in terms of tasks, the IPASS qualification and experience requirement suggest a higher level of expertise.  Therefore, a more appropriate classification might be found within the "Technicians and Associate Professionals" (Major Group 3) category, but none of the provided options fit well.

**ISCO Code:** 4313
**ISCO Title:** Payroll Clerks
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Reasoning:** The core tasks and responsibilities align strongly with the description of Payroll Clerks. However, the required IPASS qualification and experience suggest a potentially higher skill level than typically associated with this unit.

**Alternative ISCO Codes:** 3313 (Accounting and Bookkeeping Associate Professionals), 2411 (Accountants), 4416 (Other Clerical Support Workers).  These are provided as potentially more suitable alternatives if 4313 is deemed insufficient due to the specialized qualification, with 3313 being the most likely alternative due to its focus on accounting and bookkeeping tasks which are related to payroll.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Pharmacist Manager." The description emphasizes pharmaceutical expertise, customer service, leadership, and management responsibilities within a community pharmacy setting.  The role involves ensuring medicine availability, dispensing, advising patients, leading a team, and managing relationships with healthcare organizations.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2262 - Pharmacists:** While the job involves pharmaceutical duties, the primary focus is on management.  The title "Manager" is prominent. This suggests a higher-level role than a staff pharmacist.
    * **1342 - Health Services Managers:** This is a closer match as it involves managing health services. However, the specific pharmaceutical expertise and regulatory requirements (GPhC registration) point towards a more specialized role.
    * **1343 - Aged Care Services Managers:** This is not a good fit, as the job is within a community pharmacy, not an aged care facility.
    * **1344 - Social Welfare Managers:**  This is also not relevant, as the job is not related to social welfare programs.
    * **1420 - Retail and Wholesale Trade Managers:** While the pharmacy sells products, the core service is healthcare, not retail. The specialized knowledge and regulatory requirements distinguish this role from a general retail manager.
    * **3213 - Pharmaceutical Technicians and Assistants:** This is clearly incorrect. The job requires a degree in Pharmacy and GPhC registration, indicating a higher level of qualification and responsibility.
    * **5221 - Shopkeepers:** This is not appropriate. The role requires significant management and leadership responsibilities, unlike a shopkeeper operating a small independent business.
    * **5222 - Shop supervisors:** This is also incorrect. The job description emphasizes strategic and operational management, exceeding the scope of a shop supervisor.
    * **9334 - Shelf fillers:** This is completely irrelevant to the advertised role.

3. **Consider Skills and Qualifications:** The job requires a degree in Pharmacy, GPhC registration, proficiency in pharmacy systems, leadership skills, and experience in a community pharmacy setting. These requirements align with a managerial role within the pharmaceutical field.

4. **Reasoning:** The job title "Pharmacist Manager" and the description clearly indicate a managerial role within a pharmacy. The responsibilities include both pharmaceutical expertise and team/business management.  While ISCO 2262 - Pharmacists encompasses some of the duties, the managerial aspect is paramount.  ISCO 1342 - Health Services Managers is a broader category and doesn't fully capture the specialized nature of pharmacy management.

5. **Final Prediction:**
    ISCO Code: 1342
    ISCO Title: Health Services Managers
    Confidence: 0.8
    Reasoning: This job requires managing a pharmacy, a health service setting.  While the role requires pharmaceutical expertise (ISCO 2262), the managerial aspect is dominant. This ISCO code is the closest fit among the provided options, although it lacks the specific pharmacy focus.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The job title is "Hod Carrier."  This directly matches one of the listed similar job titles for ISCO unit 9313.

2. **Analyze the job description:** The key responsibilities include working alongside bricklayers, delivering bricks and materials, assisting trades, and varied site duties. These tasks align with the description of a building construction laborer, specifically a hod carrier, who supports bricklayers and other tradespeople by transporting materials.

3. **Analyze required skills and qualifications:** The job ad mentions requirements for a valid CSCS card (Construction Skills Certification Scheme), own hod, own PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), and references. These are typical requirements for construction laborers and indicate a basic level of skill and safety awareness.  No specialized skills are mentioned.

4. **Analyze ISCO classifications:** The most relevant ISCO unit, 9313 (Building construction labourers), falls under Major Group 9 (Elementary Occupations) and Sub-major Group 93 (Labourers in Mining, Construction, Manufacturing and Transport). This aligns with the nature of the job, which involves basic, manual tasks in a construction setting.

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:** While other ISCO units relate to construction, none fit as well as 9313.  For instance, 7112 (Bricklayers and related workers) involves skilled bricklaying, which is distinct from the supporting role of a hod carrier.  Similarly, 7111 (House builders) has a broader scope and higher level of responsibility than the advertised role.

ISCO Code: 9313
ISCO Title: Building construction labourers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title "Hod Carrier" and the described responsibilities of delivering materials and assisting tradespeople directly match the definition and tasks of a building construction laborer within ISCO unit 9313.  The required qualifications (CSCS card, PPE) further support this classification.
Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.  The provided top match is perfectly suitable.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Pagar-kondiiter," which translates to "Baker-Confectioner."  The description emphasizes the preparation of bakery and confectionery products.

2. **Review the tasks and responsibilities:** The primary duty listed is "Pagari- ja kondiitritoodete valmistamine," meaning "Preparation of bakery and confectionery products." This aligns perfectly with the tasks of an ISCO 7512: Bakers, Pastry-cooks and Confectionery Makers.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:**  The advertisement specifies a requirement of at least one year of experience in a similar role and vocational education. This suggests a level of skill consistent with ISCO 7512.  While a specific skill level isn't explicitly stated, the required experience implies it's beyond elementary occupations.

4. **Evaluate the ISCO code 7512:** This unit falls under Major Group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers) and Sub-Major Group 75 (Food Processing, Woodworking, Garment and Other Craft and Related Trades Workers).  The focus on skilled manual work in food preparation aligns perfectly with the job advertisement.

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:**  While other units like Cooks (5120) or Fast food preparers (9411) involve food preparation, they don't specifically address the specialized skills of baking and confectionery making. The other provided ISCO units are even less relevant.

ISCO Code: 7512
ISCO Title: Bakers, Pastry-cooks and Confectionery Makers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, required experience, and tasks align perfectly with the definition and tasks of a Baker/Pastry-cook/Confectionery Maker.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Translation and Summary:** The job advertisement is for a Security Guard (Pracownik ochrony) in Świerkówki, Poland.  The job involves monitoring the property against theft and vandalism, keeping a computer log of vehicle and pedestrian traffic, regular patrols, and maintaining a record of incidents.  A clean criminal record is required, and prior security experience is preferred.

2. **Analysis of Potential ISCO Units:**

* **5414 - Security Guards:** This is the most relevant ISCO unit. The job description closely matches the tasks outlined in the advertisement: patrolling, controlling access, monitoring for theft/vandalism, and responding to incidents. The required "niekaralności" (clean criminal record) aligns with the security nature of this role.  The job title "Pracownik ochrony" translates directly to "Security Guard."

* **Other Provided ISCO Units:**  None of the other provided ISCO units are a good fit.  They relate to social work, personal services, police, prison guards, other protective services, street vendors, sweepers, and odd-job persons.  None of these align with the core duties and responsibilities described in the advertisement.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 5414
ISCO Title: Security Guards
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job duties (patrolling, monitoring for theft/vandalism, access control) and required qualifications (clean criminal record) align perfectly with the description of Security Guards in ISCO unit 5414. The job title also directly translates to Security Guard.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.  The provided 5414 is a perfect match, making alternatives unnecessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Paint Sprayer," and the description emphasizes spraying paint in a Main Dealer Bodyshop environment, focusing on vehicle repair.

2. **Review ISCO 7132 (Spray painters and varnishers):** This unit's description explicitly mentions "painting cars, buses, trucks and other vehicles," and applying protective coatings, aligning perfectly with the job ad.  The tasks include preparing surfaces and using spray painting equipment. The provided similar job titles include "Painter, vehicle" and "Spray-painter, manufactured articles," further reinforcing the match.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:** While ISCO 7131 (Painters and related workers) involves painting, it doesn't specifically focus on vehicle painting or spray painting. ISCO 7316 (Signwriters, decorative painters, engravers and etchers) is more artistic and less relevant to vehicle repair.  The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant, dealing with plastering, building cleaning, pest control, metal coating, vehicle cleaning, general cleaning, and odd jobs.

4. **Conclusion:** ISCO 7132 is the most appropriate unit, as it directly relates to the core responsibilities and context described in the job advertisement.

ISCO Code: 7132
ISCO Title: Spray painters and varnishers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description explicitly mentions vehicle painting using spray equipment in a bodyshop context, which aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks of ISCO 7132.  The required skills and qualifications also match this ISCO unit.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Toolmaker" and the description emphasizes repairing, modifying, and maintaining existing production tooling, and manufacturing new injection mould tools.  The job requires experience with a range of toolroom machines and the ability to manufacture full mould tooling and modular systems.

2. **Evaluate ISCO 7222 (Toolmakers and related workers):** This unit's description aligns perfectly with the job advertisement.  The tasks listed, such as reading engineering drawings, visualizing dimensions, operating CNC machines, and fitting/assembling parts, all match the Toolmaker role described. The job title "Toolmaker" is explicitly mentioned as an example occupation within this unit.

3. **Consider Other ISCO Units:** While other units involve working with metal or machinery, none fit as well as 7222. ISCO 7223 (Metal working machine tool setters and operators) focuses on operating standardized machines, whereas the advertisement emphasizes custom tooling. ISCO 7221 (Blacksmiths, hammersmiths and forging press workers) involves forging and shaping metal, not the precision machining and assembly required for toolmaking.  ISCO 7211 (Metal moulders and coremakers) is focused on creating moulds for casting, not the tools themselves. The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant, dealing with woodworking, shoemaking, rubber, and plastics.

4. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 7222
ISCO Title: Toolmakers and related workers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description directly match the definition and tasks described in ISCO unit 7222. The Toolmaker's responsibilities of creating and maintaining injection mould tools align perfectly with this unit's focus on custom-made and specialized tools.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The job title is "Joiner."

2. **Analyze the job description:** The job description mentions installing timber framing for a parapet roof. This involves working with wood and constructing a specific part of a roof structure.  The ad also specifies experience in joinery and requires a CSCS card (Construction Skills Certification Scheme), indicating construction work.

3. **Compare with ISCO descriptions:**
    * **7115 - Carpenters and Joiners:** This ISCO unit's description includes tasks like making, altering, and repairing wooden structures, fitting internal and external fixtures, and working on construction sites. The examples include "Joiner" and "Framer," which directly relate to the job title and description.

4. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires 4 years of joinery experience and a CSCS card, aligning with the skill level and typical qualifications for a carpenter/joiner.

5. **Evaluate other potentially relevant ISCO units:**
    * **7111 - House Builders:** While related to construction, this unit focuses on erecting and maintaining entire houses, which is broader than the specific joinery tasks described.

    * **7119 - Building Frame and Related Trades Workers, n.e.c.:** This unit includes diverse roles like steeplejacks and scaffolders, which don't match the job description.
    * **7121 - Roofers:** While the job involves a roof, the focus is on the timber framing, a joinery task, rather than roofing materials.
    * **7123 - Plasterers:** This unit is irrelevant to the job description.
    * **7214 - Structural Metal Preparers and Erectors:** This unit involves metalwork, not woodworking.
    * **7522 - Cabinet-makers and Related Workers:** While both involve woodworking, cabinet making focuses on furniture and smaller items, whereas the job ad describes structural work on a building.
    * **9313 - Building Construction Labourers:** This unit involves assisting skilled tradespeople, while the job ad seeks an experienced joiner.
    * **9622 - Odd-job Persons:** This unit involves general maintenance and simple repairs, not specialized construction work.

ISCO Code: 7115
ISCO Title: Carpenters and Joiners
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title is "Joiner," and the description focuses on installing timber framing, which aligns perfectly with the tasks and examples within the 7115 - Carpenters and Joiners ISCO unit.  The required experience and CSCS card further support this classification.

Response:
Job Advertisement Translation:

**Title:** Clothing Pattern Maker
**Description:** Clothing Pattern Maker.  A tailoring workshop is hiring a clothing pattern maker for women's clothing for the domestic market. Requirements: experience in executing the product from start to finish. We offer: attractive salary, pleasant work environment, 8-16 schedule.

Reasoning Process:

1. **ISCO 2163 (Product and garment designers):** While the job title includes "Modelier" which might be interpreted as "Designer," the description emphasizes the execution of the product "from start to finish." This suggests a hands-on role in the production process, rather than the conceptual design work typical of a 2163.

2. **ISCO 5241 (Fashion and other models):** This is clearly not a match. The advertisement is for someone making clothes, not modeling them.

3. **ISCO 7318 (Handicraft workers in textile, leather and related materials):**  This unit focuses on traditional handicraft techniques. The advertisement doesn't mention traditional methods, and a modern tailoring workshop likely uses contemporary techniques.

4. **ISCO 7531 (Tailors, dressmakers, furriers and hatters):** This is a close match. The job involves making women's clothing, which aligns with the tasks of a dressmaker.  The "start to finish" requirement suggests a comprehensive understanding of garment construction.

5. **ISCO 7532 (Garment and related patternmakers and cutters):** This is the most appropriate ISCO unit. The job title explicitly mentions "Pattern Maker," and the description's emphasis on "executing the product from start to finish" aligns with the patternmaker's role in guiding the entire production process from design to cutting.

6. **ISCO 7533 (Sewing, embroidery and related workers):** While sewing is likely involved, the primary role is pattern making, not sewing or embroidery.

7. **ISCO 7535 (Pelt dressers, tanners and fellmongers):** This is irrelevant to the job advertisement, as it deals with preparing animal hides.

8. **ISCO 7536 (Shoemakers and related workers):** This is also irrelevant, as the job is focused on clothing, not footwear.

9. **ISCO 8153 (Sewing machine operators):** While a pattern maker might use a sewing machine, their primary role is creating and cutting patterns, not operating a sewing machine.

10. **ISCO 8159 (Textile, fur and leather products machine operators not elsewhere classified):** This is too general and doesn't accurately reflect the specialized skills of a pattern maker.


Final Prediction:

ISCO Code: 7532
ISCO Title: Garment and related patternmakers and cutters
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title explicitly states "Pattern Maker," and the description emphasizes creating the entire product, aligning perfectly with the responsibilities of a garment patternmaker.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title "Hôte(esse) de caisse (h/f)" translates to "Cashier (m/f)" in English. The job description highlights responsibilities such as welcoming customers, processing payments, and maintaining the workspace.  The advertisement emphasizes customer service skills, efficiency, and autonomy.  A plus is experience in large-scale distribution (likely a supermarket or similar environment).

2. **Analysis of Provided ISCO Units:**

* **5230 - Cashiers and Ticket Clerks:** This is the most relevant unit. The tasks described in the advertisement (welcoming customers, handling payments, maintaining workspace) directly align with the cashier's role. The required skills (customer service, efficiency, autonomy) also match the ISCO description.

* **Other Provided Options:**  None of the other provided ISCO units are a good fit.  3333 (Employment agents) is irrelevant. 4211 (Contact centre information clerks) involves remote communication, not in-person customer service. 4222 (Mail carriers) deals with mail, not sales. 4412 (Mail carriers and sorting clerks) is also related to mail. 5223 (Shop sales assistants) has a broader sales role beyond cashiering. 5246 (Food service counter attendants) focuses on food service, while 9334 (Shelf fillers) and 9621 (Messengers) are elementary occupations not requiring customer interaction or financial transactions. 9629 (Other elementary workers) is a catch-all category for elementary workers not elsewhere classified and is too general.

3. **Final Prediction:**

* **ISCO Code:** 5230
* **ISCO Title:** Cashiers and Ticket Clerks
* **Confidence:** 1.0
* **Reasoning:** The job responsibilities, required skills, and context of the advertisement strongly align with the description of Cashiers and Ticket Clerks. The French title "Hôte(esse) de caisse" directly translates to Cashier, further confirming this classification.
* **Alternative ISCO Codes:**  None.  The provided 5230 is a perfect match, so no alternatives are needed.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title "CAMERIERI/E ADDETTI/E ALLE COLAZIONI" translates to "Waiters/Breakfast Attendants."  The description emphasizes serving breakfast, handling customer interactions, table setup (mise en place), and general restaurant duties.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists duties such as ensuring customer satisfaction, supporting the Chef de Rang (head waiter), table setting, preparing tables, maintaining cleanliness, clearing tables, and serving. These align strongly with waiter duties.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires a high school diploma in tourism/hotel management, knowledge of etiquette and food/wine, customer service skills, precision, English fluency, and experience as a waiter in luxury settings.  These qualifications point towards a skilled waiter position.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:**  The most relevant provided ISCO unit, 5131 (Waiters), falls under Major group 5 (Service and Sales Workers), Sub-major group 51 (Personal Service Workers). This aligns perfectly with the job description.

5. **Comparison with other ISCO units:** While other ISCO units relate to the hospitality industry, none fit as precisely as 5131.  For example:
    * 1411 (Hotel Managers) and 1412 (Restaurant Managers) involve managerial responsibilities not mentioned in the ad.
    * 3434 (Chefs) focuses on food preparation, not serving.
    * 4224 (Hotel Receptionists) deals with guest registration and accommodation, not dining.
    * 5111 (Travel Attendants) work on transportation, not in hotels.
    * 5151 (Cleaning and Housekeeping Supervisors) and 5152 (Domestic Housekeepers) focus on cleaning and housekeeping, not serving.
    * 9112 (Cleaners and Helpers) and 9412 (Kitchen Helpers) involve supporting roles, not direct customer service.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 5131
ISCO Title: Waiters
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description focuses on serving customers, setting tables, and other duties typical of a waiter, aligning perfectly with ISCO 5131. The required skills and qualifications also match this ISCO unit.

Job Ad ID: 855577676, Row: 25389, Pred: 2635, 3412, 5311, 1344, 3253, 3259, 5322, 4229, 3221, 2342
Response:
1. **Analyze ISCO 2635: Social work and counselling professionals:** This ISCO unit aligns strongly with the job title and description. The tasks described in the advertisement, such as assessing potential foster parents, monitoring children in foster care, and assisting with family access visits, directly correspond to the tasks listed within this ISCO unit (interviewing clients, assessing situations, planning programs of assistance). The required qualification as a Social Worker and registration with CORU further solidifies this match.

2. **Analyze other ISCO units:** While other ISCO units relate to aspects of the job, none fit as comprehensively as 2635. ISCO 3412 (Social work associate professionals) involves implementing social assistance programs, which is not the primary focus of this role. ISCO 3253 and 3259 (Community health workers and other health associate professionals) involve providing health education and services, which are not central to the advertised position.  ISCO 1344 (Social welfare managers) focuses on management and administrative tasks, not direct social work with children and families. ISCO 2342 (Early childhood educators) focuses on the educational development of children, not on social welfare and foster care. ISCO 3221 (Nursing associate professionals) involves providing basic nursing and personal care, which is not relevant to this role. ISCO 4229 (Client information workers) focuses on gathering information for service eligibility, not providing social work services. ISCO 5311 (Child care workers) and 5322 (Home-based personal care workers) focus on providing direct care, not social work assessments and support.

3. **Conclusion:** ISCO 2635 is the most appropriate match, as it accurately reflects the job title, description, tasks, required skills, and qualifications.

ISCO Code: 2635
ISCO Title: Social work and counselling professionals
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title is "Social Worker," and the description focuses on assessing potential foster parents, monitoring children in foster care, and supporting families—all core tasks of social work professionals. The requirement of a social work qualification and CORU registration confirms this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Commercial Litigation Solicitor." The description emphasizes experience in handling various commercial disputes, including contractual disputes, professional negligence claims, injunctions, and shareholder disputes.  The ad also mentions contentious probate work.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO descriptions and titles:** The provided ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers) explicitly includes "Solicitor" as an example occupation and its description aligns perfectly with the job ad's responsibilities, such as providing legal advice, researching legal principles, gathering evidence, and pleading cases.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The job ad requires 3+ years of post-qualification experience (PQE), indicating a high skill level, which corresponds with the skill level 3 assigned to ISCO unit 2611.

4. **Evaluate major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 2611 falls under Major group 2 (Professionals), Sub-major group 26 (Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals), which accurately reflects the nature of the advertised role.

5. **Consider other provided ISCO units:**  While other ISCO units like 2619 (Legal Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified) might seem relevant at first glance, they do not encompass the core duties of a litigation solicitor, which involve representing clients in court.  The remaining ISCO units are clearly not relevant, focusing on sales, business services, clerical work, and other non-legal professions.

ISCO Code: 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title "Commercial Litigation Solicitor" directly matches the examples provided in ISCO 2611 (Lawyers).  The job description's emphasis on litigation and dispute resolution aligns perfectly with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for this ISCO unit. The required experience (3+ PQE) confirms the high skill level associated with this profession.

    * **2424 (Training and staff development professionals):** While there might be some overlap in identifying training needs, this ISCO unit focuses on training program development and implementation, which is not the primary focus of the Talent Acquisition Specialist role.
    * **2431 (Advertising and marketing professionals):**  While sourcing candidates involves some marketing-like activities, the core focus is different. This ISCO unit is less relevant.
    * **3153 (Aircraft pilots and related associate professionals):**  Completely irrelevant to the job advertisement.
    * **3333 (Employment agents and contractors):** This is also a good match, as it involves matching jobseekers with vacancies. However, 2423 is a better fit because the Talent Acquisition Specialist role is broader than simply matching candidates to open positions. It involves strategic planning and partnership with the business.
    * **3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified):** This is too general and doesn't accurately reflect the specialized nature of talent acquisition.
    * **4221 (Travel consultants and clerks):** Irrelevant to the job advertisement.
    * **5111 (Travel attendants and travel stewards):** Irrelevant to the job advertisement.
    * **5113 (Travel guides):** Irrelevant to the job advertisement.
    * **5249 (Sales workers not elsewhere classified):** While there's an element of "selling" the company to potential candidates, this is not the primary focus. This ISCO unit is less relevant.

3. **Consider Skills and Qualifications:** The job ad requires experience in recruitment, corporate experience as a plus, sourcing and attraction skills, and excellent communication skills. These align well with ISCO 2423.

4. **Major/Sub-major/Minor Groups:** The most relevant major group is "2 - Professionals," which aligns with the strategic and specialized nature of the role. The sub-major group "24 - Business and Administration Professionals" is also a good fit.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2423
ISCO Title: Personnel and careers professionals
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: The job responsibilities heavily involve recruitment, strategic talent acquisition planning, and partnering with the business, aligning strongly with the description of "Personnel and careers professionals."

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Data Entry Supervisor (Night shift)." The description emphasizes supervising a data entry team, ensuring data accuracy, handling customs information, generating reports, and training staff.  The required skills include attention to detail, communication, data entry speed and accuracy, and familiarity with customs procedures.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **3121 (Mining supervisors):**  Clearly irrelevant. The job has nothing to do with mining.
    * **3122 (Manufacturing supervisors):** Irrelevant. The job is not in a manufacturing setting.
    * **3341 (Office supervisors):**  Highly relevant. The job title "Data Entry Supervisor" is listed as a similar job title. The description of supervising clerical workers, including data entry clerks, aligns perfectly.
    * **4132 (Data entry clerks):**  Not a good fit. While data entry is involved, the job is supervisory, not a clerk position.
    * **4321 (Stock clerks):** Irrelevant. The job is not about managing physical stock.
    * **4323 (Transport clerks):**  Partially relevant due to the logistics context and mention of "goods travelling." However, the core responsibilities are data entry and supervision, not transport coordination.
    * **4416 (Personnel clerks):** Irrelevant. The job is not focused on personnel records.
    * **5151 (Cleaning and housekeeping supervisors):** Irrelevant. The job has nothing to do with cleaning.
    * **5222 (Shop supervisors):** Irrelevant. The job is not in a retail setting.
    * **9334 (Shelf fillers):**  Completely irrelevant.

3. **Determine the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit:** 3341 (Office supervisors) is the best match. The job title, description, required skills, and supervisory nature align perfectly with the definition of this ISCO unit.

ISCO Code: 3341
ISCO Title: Office supervisors
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description clearly indicate a supervisory role overseeing data entry clerks, which aligns perfectly with the definition of Office supervisors (ISCO 3341).  The required skills and responsibilities further reinforce this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "18th Edition Commercial Electrician."  This points towards a skilled trade role involving electrical work in commercial settings. The description emphasizes installation, maintenance, repair, inspection, and testing, along with adherence to regulations.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO descriptions and titles:**  The closest match among the provided options is ISCO 7411 (Building and related electricians).  The tasks described within this unit, such as installing, maintaining, and repairing electrical wiring systems, inspecting systems, and testing continuity, align well with the job advertisement.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The advertisement mentions the requirement for 18th Edition certification, which relates to the UK's wiring regulations. This reinforces the connection to ISCO 7411, as adherence to regulations is a key aspect of the described tasks.  The mention of "SJIB Rates" further strengthens this link, as SJIB (Scottish Joint Industry Board) sets pay rates for electricians in Scotland.  The requirement for a driving license suggests site visits and potentially working across different locations, which is common for electricians.

4. **Evaluate major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 7411 falls under Major Group 7 (Craft and Related Trades Workers), Sub-Major Group 74 (Electrical and Electronics Trades Workers). This classification accurately reflects the hands-on, skilled nature of the advertised role.

5. **Consider other provided ISCO units:** While other units relate to electrical work (e.g., 7412, 7413, 3113), they are not as precise a match.  ISCO 7412 (Electrical mechanics and fitters) focuses on machinery and apparatus, not building wiring systems. ISCO 7413 (Electrical line installers and repairers) deals with transmission and supply cables, a different area of expertise. ISCO 3113 (Electrical engineering technicians) is a more technically oriented role involving design and testing, not the direct installation and maintenance described in the advertisement.

ISCO Code: 7411
ISCO Title: Building and related electricians
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, required qualifications (18th Edition), and mention of SJIB rates all strongly indicate a role focused on installing, maintaining, and repairing electrical systems in commercial buildings, aligning perfectly with the definition of ISCO 7411.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Healthcare Assistant Framework." The description emphasizes providing patient care, working under the guidance of nursing staff, and assisting with personal care needs. This aligns with several potential ISCO unit descriptions, particularly those related to nursing and personal care.

2. **Review main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists responsibilities such as providing quality care, working as part of a team, and shift allocation ranging from specializing to nursing support.  Tasks include general patient care and nursing support. These tasks align strongly with the description of ISCO 5321: Health Care Assistants.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The job requires a FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Healthcare Support/Pre-nursing Studies, experience in a caring/support role, and specific immunizations. This level of qualification and required experience further supports the classification as a Health Care Assistant (5321).

4. **Evaluate major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 5321 falls under Major Group 5 (Services and Sales Workers), Sub-Major Group 53 (Personal Care Workers), and Minor Group 532 (Personal Care Workers in Health Services).  The job description clearly falls within the scope of these groups.  While some tasks might seem to overlap with nursing associate professionals (3221), the required qualifications and emphasis on direct personal care under supervision point more definitively to 5321.

ISCO Code: 5321
ISCO Title: Health Care Assistants
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description emphasizes direct personal care, assistance with daily living activities, and working under the supervision of nurses and other health professionals in a hospital setting.  The required qualifications and listed responsibilities align perfectly with the ISCO 5321 definition.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title "INGATLAN TANÁCSADÓ" translates to "Real Estate Consultant" or "Real Estate Advisor". The description emphasizes tasks such as advising clients on buying and selling properties, negotiating deals, managing property viewings, and handling contracts.  The job also mentions commission-based earnings.

2. **Compare with Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **3334 - Real estate agents and property managers:** This is a strong match. The job description aligns perfectly with the tasks described for this ISCO unit, including arranging sales, facilitating negotiations, drawing up agreements, and managing properties. The commission-based compensation also fits this category.

3. **Evaluate Other ISCO Units:**  While some other ISCO units might seem tangentially related, none fit as well as 3334. For example:
    * **3333 - Employment agents and contractors:** While this involves matching people with opportunities, it focuses on general employment rather than the specific area of real estate.
    * **2529 - Database and network professionals not elsewhere classified:** This is entirely unrelated to the job advertisement.
    * **2423 - Personnel and careers professionals:** This focuses on internal HR functions within a company, not external client-facing real estate advising.
    * **2411 - Accountants:**  No relation to the real estate consultant role.
    * **4229 - Client information workers, not elsewhere classified:** This involves gathering information for eligibility purposes, not real estate transactions.
    * **4312 - Statistical, finance and insurance clerks:** While the job might involve some financial aspects, the core responsibilities are not clerical in nature.
    * **5244 - Contact centre salespersons:**  This involves selling via phone or internet, which is not the primary focus of a real estate consultant who typically works directly with clients and shows properties.
    * **9622 - Odd-job persons:**  Completely unrelated to the advertised role.

4. **Final Prediction:**

    **ISCO Code:** 3334
    **ISCO Title:** Real estate agents and property managers
    **Confidence:** 1.0
    **Reasoning:** The job responsibilities described in the advertisement directly match the tasks and description of ISCO unit 3334.  The focus on real estate transactions, client interaction, negotiation, and commission-based pay strongly supports this classification.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title "MONTATORE PONTEGGI" translates to "Scaffolding Erector" in English. The description confirms the primary responsibility is assembling and dismantling scaffolding (2-5 meters high).  The requirement of national travel suggests project-based work.

2. **ISCO 7119 (Building Frame and Related Trades Workers):** This is the most relevant unit. The description explicitly includes "scaffolders" and the task of "erecting temporary metal or wooden scaffolding on building sites" aligns perfectly with the job advertisement.

3. **Other ISCO Units:**  The other provided ISCO units are less relevant:
    * **7114 (Concrete placers, concrete finishers and related workers):**  Deals with concrete work, not scaffolding.
    * **7133 (Building structure cleaners):** Focuses on cleaning building exteriors, not construction.
    * **7214 (Structural metal preparers and erectors):**  Involves preparing and erecting structural metal frames, a different trade from scaffolding.
    * **7215 (Riggers and cable splicers):** While rigging can be involved in construction, this role is broader and not focused solely on scaffolding.
    * **7223 (Metal working machine tool setters and operators):**  Operates machinery, not erecting structures.
    * **8211 (Mechanical machinery assemblers):** Assembles machinery in a factory setting, not scaffolding on construction sites.
    * **8343 (Crane, hoist and related plant operators):** Operates heavy machinery, not erecting scaffolding.
    * **9312 (Civil engineering labourers):** Performs basic manual labor, while a scaffolder requires specialized skills.
    * **9313 (Building construction labourers):**  General laborers who assist skilled tradespeople.  A scaffolder is a skilled trade itself.


**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 7119
ISCO Title: Building Frame and Related Trades Workers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title and description clearly indicate the role is a scaffolder, which is explicitly mentioned within the ISCO 7119 description and tasks.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None. The provided 7119 is a perfect fit, making alternatives unnecessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The Training Director is responsible for designing, overseeing, and managing all learning and development programs within the organization.  Key responsibilities include needs analysis, curriculum development, budget management, and evaluating training effectiveness.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2424 - Training and staff development professionals:** This is the most relevant unit. The job description closely aligns with the tasks and responsibilities of this ISCO unit, including identifying training needs, developing training materials, conducting programs, and evaluating effectiveness.  The focus on improving employee skills, quality of work, productivity, and retention further reinforces this classification.

3. **Consider Alternative ISCO Units:** While 2424 is a strong match, let's consider other options:
    * **1212 - Human resource managers:** While this role involves training, the overall scope of a Human Resource Manager is broader, encompassing personnel, industrial relations, and occupational health and safety. The Training Director role focuses specifically on learning and development.
    * **1345 - Education managers:** This unit is more focused on formal educational settings like schools, colleges, and universities. The Training Director role is within a business context and not directly comparable to managing an educational institution.
    * **2356 - Information technology trainers:** This is too narrow. While the Training Director *might* oversee IT training, their responsibility covers all training needs within the organization, not just IT.
    * The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant, focusing on chief executives, policy planning, research and development, ICT services, childcare, or senior officials in special-interest organizations.

4. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2424
ISCO Title: Training and staff development professionals
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for Training and staff development professionals, including needs analysis, curriculum development, program delivery, and evaluation. The focus on employee development within a business context further supports this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Labourer" and the description emphasizes assisting tradespeople, carrying out pre-plastering work, maintaining site cleanliness, and general laboring tasks on a new build housing site.  A CSCS card (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) is required, indicating construction work.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **9313 - Building construction labourers:** This is the most relevant unit. The job description aligns strongly with the tasks outlined for this unit, such as assisting tradespeople (bricklayers, carpenters, etc.), handling materials, cleaning the site, and performing basic construction tasks.  The requirement of a CSCS card further reinforces this classification.

3. **Consider Alternative ISCO Units:** While 9313 is a strong match, let's consider other options:
    * **7111 - House builders:** This unit involves more skilled and autonomous construction work, including erecting structures, roofing, and coordinating subcontractors. The labourer role in the advertisement is clearly an assisting role, not a lead builder role.
    * **7119 - Building frame and related trades workers not elsewhere classified:** This unit includes specialized roles like scaffolders and demolition workers, which are not mentioned in the job ad.
    * **Other provided ISCO units:** The remaining ISCO units relate to agricultural, forestry, mining, quarrying, civil engineering, odd jobs, and gardening/horticulture. None of these align with the job advertisement's focus on new build housing construction.

4. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 9313
ISCO Title: Building construction labourers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description clearly outlines tasks consistent with a building construction labourer on a housing site. The requirement of a CSCS card confirms the construction context.  The job involves assisting trades, site cleaning, and pre-plastering work, all typical duties of this ISCO unit.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title "Summer Trainee, Offering Management" suggests a role related to product/service management, potentially involving market analysis, pricing strategies, and sales support.  The description mentions "improving the...", hinting at optimization and development within the offering management function.  It's a trainee position, implying an entry-level role focused on learning and development.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**

* **1221 - Sales and marketing managers:** While offering management is related to sales and marketing, this ISCO unit focuses on *managing* these functions.  The trainee position is likely not at a management level.
* **1324 - Supply, distribution and related managers:** This is not relevant, as the job ad doesn't mention logistics, transportation, or supply chain management.
* **1330 - Information and communications technology services managers:** This is also not a match, as the focus is on IT systems, not product/service offerings.
* **1439 - Other services managers:** This is a broader category, but the examples provided (camp site manager, travel agency manager) don't align with offering management.
* **2356 - Information technology trainers:**  Not relevant, as the role is not about training others on IT.
* **2424 - Training and staff development professionals:**  Not relevant, the trainee is receiving training, not providing it.
* **2431 - Advertising and marketing professionals:** Closer to the job description, as offering management involves understanding market needs and promoting offerings. However, the trainee aspect suggests a lower skill level and less autonomy than a full professional role.
* **3522 - Telecommunications engineering technicians:** Not relevant, as the job is not focused on telecommunications technology.
* **4323 - Transport clerks:** Not relevant, as the job is not related to transport operations.
* **5112 - Transport conductors:** Not relevant, as the job is not related to passenger transport.

3. **Consider Alternatives:** Since none of the provided ISCO units perfectly match, consider alternatives:

* **3315 - Market research interviewers:**  This could be a possibility if the trainee role involves gathering market data and customer feedback.
* **4226 - Client information workers:** This might be relevant if the trainee interacts with customers and manages client data related to offerings.
* **3343 - Sales and marketing clerks:** This could be a good fit if the trainee supports sales and marketing activities related to the offerings.

4. **Final Prediction:**

**ISCO Code:** 3343
**ISCO Title:** Sales and marketing clerks
**Confidence:** 0.7
**Reasoning:**  Offering management involves supporting sales and marketing efforts.  As a trainee, the role likely involves tasks such as market analysis, pricing research, and sales support, aligning with the clerk level.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The title "Industrial Scaffolders" clearly points towards scaffolding as the primary job function.

2. **Review the job description:** The description emphasizes "Scaffolding on an outage" as the main duty, further reinforcing the focus on scaffolding tasks.  The requirement of a CISRS card (Construction Industry Scaffolders Record Scheme) confirms that the role requires certified scaffolding skills.

3. **Compare with ISCO 7119 (Building frame and related trades workers):** This unit explicitly includes "Scaffolders" in its examples and describes tasks such as "erecting temporary metal or wooden scaffolding on building sites."  The job description aligns perfectly with this ISCO unit.

4. **Consider other ISCO options:** While other ISCO units relate to construction, none are as specific and fitting as 7119.  For instance, ISCO 3123 (Construction supervisors) involves supervisory tasks not mentioned in the advertisement. ISCO 7133 (Structural metal preparers and erectors) deals with permanent metal structures, not temporary scaffolding.  ISCO 7215 (Riggers and cable splicers) involves rigging equipment, which is distinct from scaffolding.  The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant.

ISCO Code: 7119
ISCO Title: Building frame and related trades workers not elsewhere classified
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, required certifications (CISRS), and primary duty of "scaffolding on an outage" all directly correspond to the definition and tasks described within ISCO unit 7119.
Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.  The provided 7119 is a perfect match, making alternatives unnecessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Credit & Collection Analyst with German." The description emphasizes managing outstanding accounts, contacting customers with overdue payments, recording financial information, and establishing/monitoring credit limits.  The required skills include German and English language proficiency, accounting/economic background (preferred), interpersonal and organizational skills, and MS Office proficiency.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2411 (Accountants):** While the job involves financial records, it doesn't focus on accounting systems, preparing financial statements, or auditing.  The focus is on collections, not general accounting.
    * **2413 (Financial Analysts):** This is not a good fit. The job doesn't involve investment analysis, forecasting economic conditions, or recommending investment strategies.
    * **2421 (Management and Organization Analysts):** This is also not relevant. The job doesn't involve analyzing organizational structures, improving efficiency, or solving organizational problems.
    * **2511 (Systems Analysts):** This is completely unrelated. The job doesn't involve IT systems, software development, or system design.
    * **3312 (Credit and Loans Officers):** This is the closest match so far.  The job involves managing overdue accounts and contacting customers about payments. However, the focus is on collections, not loan applications or creditworthiness assessments.
    * **3313 (Accounting Associate Professionals):**  This is less relevant than 3312. While the job involves maintaining financial records, it's specifically related to collections, not general bookkeeping or accounting tasks.
    * **4214 (Debt Collectors):** This is a very good match. The job description aligns strongly with the tasks of a debt collector: contacting debtors, arranging payments, and recommending further action.
    * **4311 (Accounting and Bookkeeping Clerks):** While there's some overlap with recording financial data, the core responsibility is collections, not general accounting or bookkeeping.
    * **4312 (Statistical, Finance and Insurance Clerks):** This isn't a good fit.  The job doesn't involve statistical analysis, insurance transactions, or financial market activities.
    * **5244 (Contact Centre Salespersons):**  While the job involves contacting customers, the goal is collections, not sales.

3. **Determine the Most Appropriate ISCO Unit:**  4214 (Debt Collectors) is the most appropriate ISCO unit. The job description clearly focuses on collecting overdue payments, which aligns perfectly with the definition of this unit.

ISCO Code: 4214
ISCO Title: Debt collectors and related workers
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: The job responsibilities align strongly with the tasks of a debt collector, including contacting debtors, negotiating payments, and recommending further action.  The requirement of German language skills suggests a focus on international collections, which further supports this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The advertisement is for a Special Educational Needs (SEN) Teacher in Hayes, specializing in Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and Key Stage 1 (KS1).  The role requires Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and experience with SEN children, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) and moderate learning difficulties.

2. **Compare with Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2320 - Vocational Education Teachers:** This is not a good fit.  Vocational education focuses on job-specific skills, not the broader educational needs of SEN children.
    * **2330 - Secondary Education Teachers:** This is also not suitable. The role is specifically for EYFS/KS1, which falls under primary education, not secondary.
    * **2341 - Primary School Teachers:** While the age range aligns, this unit doesn't encompass the specialized skills and experience required for working with SEN children.
    * **2342 - Early Childhood Educators:**  Closer, but still not a perfect match.  While EYFS falls under early childhood, the role also includes KS1 and requires specific SEN experience.
    * **2352 - Special Needs Teachers:** This is the **best fit**. The description explicitly mentions teaching children with disabilities and learning difficulties, aligning perfectly with the job advertisement's requirements.
    * **2353 - Other Language Teachers:** Not relevant. The ad doesn't mention language teaching.
    * **2354 - Other Music Teachers:** Not relevant. The ad doesn't mention music teaching.
    * **2355 - Other Arts Teachers:** Not relevant. The ad doesn't mention arts teaching.
    * **2359 - Other Teaching Professionals:** While a broader category, 2352 is more specific and therefore a better fit.
    * **5312 - Teachers' Aides:**  Incorrect.  The advertisement explicitly seeks a qualified teacher, not an aide.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2352
ISCO Title: Special Needs Teachers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job advertisement explicitly requires experience with SEN children, aligning perfectly with the ISCO description of Special Needs Teachers. The focus on EYFS/KS1 and the required QTS further solidify this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Real Estate Litigation Solicitor." The description emphasizes experience in real estate litigation, handling landlord-tenant disputes, providing strategic advice, and managing paralegals.  The required experience is 1+ years PQE (Post Qualified Experience), indicating a qualified solicitor.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is a strong match. The job title "Solicitor" is explicitly listed as an example occupation. The description aligns with the tasks of a lawyer, including providing legal advice, researching legal principles, and representing clients. The requirement of 1+ PQE confirms professional legal qualification.
    * **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):** This is not a match. The job advertisement focuses on legal expertise, not HR or career guidance.
    * **1349 (Specialized services managers):** While the solicitor may manage paralegals, the core role is legal practice, not management.  "Legal service manager" is listed as an example, but the job description doesn't emphasize managerial duties enough for this to be the primary classification.
    * **2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** This is less specific than 2611 and doesn't capture the litigation aspect of the role.  While a solicitor can perform some tasks listed here, 2611 is a more precise fit.
    * **3315 (Valuers and loss assessors):** This is not relevant. The job is about legal disputes, not property valuation.
    * **3333 (Employment agents and contractors):** This is not relevant. The job is not about recruitment.
    * **3334 (Real estate agents and property managers):** This is not relevant. The job deals with legal aspects of real estate, not sales or management.
    * **3339 (Business services agents not elsewhere classified):** This is not relevant.  The solicitor's role is not about selling business services.
    * **3342 (Legal secretaries):** This is not a match. The solicitor is a qualified legal professional, not support staff.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** This is not a match. While the solicitor might supervise paralegals (who fall under this category), the solicitor's role requires higher qualifications and autonomy, aligning with the lawyer category (2611).

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title "Solicitor" is explicitly mentioned within the ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers). The job description focuses on core legal tasks such as advising, researching, and representing clients in real estate litigation. The required PQE signifies professional legal standing.

    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is a strong match. The job title explicitly mentions "Solicitor," a legal profession. The description highlights tasks such as acting on behalf of developers and handling legal aspects of new build conveyancing, aligning with the lawyer's role of providing legal advice and drawing up legal documents.
    * **2619 (Legal Professionals Not Elsewhere Classified):** While this unit includes legal professionals, it's for those *not* classified elsewhere. Since "Solicitor" is clearly defined within 2611, this is less appropriate.
    * **3334 (Real Estate Agents and Property Managers):** This is not a good fit. While the job deals with real estate, the focus is on the *legal* aspects, not sales, purchases, rentals, or property management.
    * **3342 (Legal Secretaries):** This is incorrect. The job requires a qualified legal professional with significant experience (4-7 years PQE), not a support role.
    * **3411 (Legal and Related Associate Professionals):**  This is also incorrect.  While related to law, this unit encompasses paralegals and legal assistants, not fully qualified solicitors.
    * The remaining ISCO units relate to construction management, architecture, house building, bricklaying, and construction labor. These are irrelevant to the solicitor role advertised.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    * **ISCO Code:** 2611
    * **ISCO Title:** Lawyers
    * **Confidence:** 1.0
    * **Reasoning:** The job title "Solicitor" and the description emphasizing legal work in residential new build conveyancing clearly fall under the scope of ISCO unit 2611 (Lawyers).
    * **Alternative ISCO Codes:**  None.  The provided 2611 is a perfect fit, making alternatives unnecessary.

The job title "Automechanik" also directly translates to "Car Mechanic."

6. **ISCO 7232 - Aircraft Engine Mechanics and Repairers:** This is not a match. The job ad explicitly states the role is within an automotive service center, focusing on cars, not aircraft.

7. **ISCO 7233 - Agricultural and Industrial Machinery Mechanics and Repairers:** This is not a match. While there's some overlap in mechanical skills, this ISCO unit focuses on machinery outside the automotive scope.

8. **ISCO 7234 - Bicycle and Related Repairers:** This is not a match. The job ad clearly specifies work on cars, not bicycles or related equipment.

9. **ISCO 7421 - Electronics Mechanics and Servicers:** This is not a match. While modern cars have electronic components, the job ad emphasizes mechanical repairs, not electronics.

10. **ISCO 8211 - Mechanical Machinery Assemblers:** This is not a match.  This ISCO unit focuses on assembly, while the job ad focuses on repair and maintenance.

11. **ISCO 9122 - Vehicle Cleaners:** This is not a match. This ISCO unit involves cleaning vehicles, not repairing them.


**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 7231
ISCO Title: Motor Vehicle Mechanics and Repairers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description and title directly align with the tasks and definition of a Motor Vehicle Mechanic, including engine repair, parts replacement, and vehicle maintenance within an authorized car service center.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None. The primary prediction is a very strong match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Job Ad ID: 804500223, Row: 25365, Pred: 2263, 3257, 1212, 1342, 3252, 5151, 2424, 3253, 2265, 3259
Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Health & Safety Officer." The description emphasizes responsibilities related to developing, implementing, and enforcing health and safety management systems, policies, and procedures.  The role involves risk assessment, training, audits, incident reporting, and liaison with external agencies.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2263 - Environmental and occupational health and hygiene professionals:** This is the most relevant unit. The job description closely aligns with the tasks described for this unit, such as developing and implementing safety programs, identifying hazards, assessing risks, advising on compliance, and providing training.  The job title "Health & Safety Officer" is also similar to the listed examples ("Occupational health and safety adviser").

3. **Consider Alternative ISCO Units:** While 2263 is a strong match, let's consider other options:
    * **3257 - Environmental and occupational health inspectors and associates:** This unit focuses on *inspecting* workplaces for compliance. While the Health & Safety Officer role includes audits, the primary focus is broader than inspection.
    * **1342 - Health services managers:** This unit is less relevant as it focuses on managing clinical and community health care services, not occupational health and safety within a specific company.
    * The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant, focusing on human resources management, dietetics, training, medical records, community health work, or housekeeping.

4. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2263
ISCO Title: Environmental and occupational health and hygiene professionals
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: The job description strongly aligns with the tasks and responsibilities outlined for ISCO unit 2263.  The job title "Health & Safety Officer" is also a close match to the example titles provided.

Alternative ISCO Codes: 3257, 1342, 2424

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Fullstack Software Engineer." The description emphasizes developing and maintaining internal tools and services, working with APIs, front-end frameworks (React/Angular), source control (Git), Linux, Docker, and CI/CD.  The role requires collaboration with sales and operations teams.

2. **Compare with ISCO 2512 (Software Developers):** This unit's description closely aligns with the job ad.  The tasks listed, such as researching, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software solutions, are all core responsibilities of a Fullstack Software Engineer. The job title "Software Engineer" is explicitly listed as an example occupation.

3. **Consider Other ISCO Units:**
    * **2513 (Web and Multimedia Development Professionals):** While there is some overlap with front-end development, the focus of this ISCO unit is on multimedia and interactive web applications. This isn't the primary focus of the advertised role.
    * **2514 (Applications Programmers):** This is more specialized than the advertised role.  A Fullstack Engineer works across the entire software stack, while an Applications Programmer typically focuses on a specific application area.
    * **2519 (Software and Applications Developers and Analysts not elsewhere classified):**  This is a broader category, but 2512 is a more precise match.
    * **2521 (Database Designers and Administrators):**  While the job mentions databases, the role is not primarily focused on database administration.
    * **2529 (Database and Network Professionals not elsewhere classified):** Even less relevant than 2521.
    * **3514 (Web Technicians):** This role is more focused on website maintenance and support, not software development.
    * **2433 (Technical and Medical Sales Professionals):**  Not relevant, as the role is not sales-focused.
    * **2434 (ICT Sales Professionals):** Not relevant, as the role is not sales-focused.
    * **2149 (Other Engineering Professionals):** Not relevant, as this encompasses other engineering disciplines outside of software.

4. **Conclusion:** ISCO 2512 (Software Developers) is the most appropriate classification.

ISCO Code (unit): 2512
ISCO Title: Software Developers

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title translates to "Cashiers - KFC in Thessaloniki (inside the Cosmos Mediterranean shopping center)." The description translates to "Cashiers - KFC in Thessaloniki (inside the Cosmos Mediterranean shopping center). The KFC restaurant in Thessaloniki (inside the Cosmos Mediterranean shopping center) is looking for part-time Cashiers with enthusiasm and team spirit. Offered: satisfactory pay, pleasant working environment, opportunities for development."  This clearly points to a customer-facing role involving handling payments.

2. **Analyzing the Provided ISCO Units:**
    * **5230 - Cashiers and Ticket Clerks:** This is the most relevant unit. The job title explicitly mentions "Cashiers," and the description emphasizes handling payments, which aligns perfectly with the tasks described for this ISCO unit (operating cash registers, accepting payments, giving change, etc.).  The location (fast food restaurant) is also a typical setting for this occupation.

    * Other provided ISCO units (4211, 5120, 5131, 5212, 5246, 9112, 9334, 9411, 9412) are less relevant. They involve food preparation, cleaning, or other tasks not mentioned in the advertisement. While a cashier in a fast-food restaurant might perform some minor food preparation or cleaning, their primary role is handling transactions.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    * **ISCO Code:** 5230
    * **ISCO Title:** Cashiers and Ticket Clerks
    * **Confidence:** 1.0
    * **Reasoning:** The job title and description directly match the definition and tasks of a Cashier, focusing on handling payments in a fast-food restaurant setting.
    * **Alternative ISCO Codes:**  None. The provided 5230 - Cashiers and Ticket Clerks is a perfect match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "CMBS Attorney, Ratings Legal". The description emphasizes legal expertise within the context of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS).  The attorney will review documents, identify credit risks, prepare reports, and stay abreast of legal and market developments.

2. **Compare with Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2611 (Lawyers):** This is a strong match. The job requires a JD, admission to the NY bar, and involves reviewing legal documents, evaluating risks, and communicating findings.  The core responsibilities align with the tasks of a lawyer specializing in finance.
    * **2423 (Personnel and careers professionals):** This is not a match. The job has no relation to personnel policies, recruitment, or career guidance.
    * **2619 (Legal professionals not elsewhere classified):** While the job involves legal work, it is specifically within the realm of CMBS and finance. 2611 (Lawyers) is a more precise and appropriate classification.
    * **3311 (Securities and finance dealers and brokers):** While the job deals with securities (CMBS), the role is focused on the *legal* aspects, not the buying and selling of securities.
    * **3312 (Credit and loans officers):**  The job involves assessing credit risk, but from a legal perspective, not a lending perspective.
    * **3324 (Trade brokers):** This is not relevant. The job doesn't involve buying and selling commodities or shipping services.
    * **3334 (Real estate agents and property managers):** While related to real estate (through CMBS), the job is fundamentally a legal role, not a real estate sales or management role.
    * **3342 (Legal secretaries):** This is not a match. The job requires a law degree and involves complex legal analysis, far exceeding the scope of a legal secretary.
    * **3411 (Legal and related associate professionals):** While the attorney may perform some tasks similar to those listed (e.g., preparing documents), the required qualifications and level of responsibility are significantly higher than those of a paralegal or legal assistant.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2611
ISCO Title: Lawyers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job requires a law degree, admission to the bar, and involves providing legal expertise within the specialized field of CMBS.  The core responsibilities align perfectly with the tasks and skills of a lawyer specializing in finance.

Alternative ISCO Codes:  None. 2611 is a perfect fit.  Other legal ISCO codes are too general or focus on different aspects of legal practice.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title translates to "Waiter / Waiter Assistant (bar) - Sithonia Halkidiki". The description indicates the campsite is seeking to hire a waiter or waiter assistant for their bar for the 2021 summer season.  Key requirements include 2-4 years of experience, preferably in a 5-star hotel, teamwork, excellent customer service skills, and optionally a tourism degree and additional language skills.

2. **ISCO 5131: Waiters:** This is the most relevant unit based on the translated title and description. The tasks described in the ISCO unit, such as taking orders, serving food and beverages, and handling payments, align with the expected duties of a waiter/waiter assistant in a bar setting.

3. **ISCO 5132: Bartenders:** While the advertisement mentions "(bar)", the description focuses on serving duties.  Bartending tasks like mixing drinks are not explicitly mentioned.  While there might be some overlap, the primary role seems to be waiting tables, potentially with a focus on beverage service.

4. **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining ISCO units are less relevant.  The ad doesn't mention responsibilities related to cooking (5120: Cooks, 9411: Fast food preparers, 9412: Kitchen helpers), management (1412: Restaurant managers), food processing (8160: Food and related products machine operators), cleaning (9112: Cleaners and helpers), or social work (3412: Social work associate professionals).  The job also doesn't involve food counter service (5246: Food service counter attendants).

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 5131
ISCO Title: Waiters
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: The job title and description clearly indicate the primary role is serving food and beverages, aligning with the tasks of a Waiter (5131). While the job is in a bar setting, bartending duties are not explicitly mentioned, making 5132: Bartenders less likely.

Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): [5132, 9412, 1412]

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Electrician," and the description emphasizes tasks like planned and reactive maintenance, fixed wiring in commercial premises, surveying existing installations, inspection, testing, installation, and fault finding on 3-phase systems.  The required qualifications include a Level 3 Apprenticeship, 18th Edition certification, Inspection & Testing certification (2391 or 2394/2395), and a driving license.  The desired candidate has experience designing electrical distribution systems and supervisory experience.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **7411 (Building and related electricians):** This unit closely aligns with the job description's focus on installation, maintenance, and repair of electrical wiring systems and related equipment in buildings. The tasks listed in the ISCO unit description match the job ad's responsibilities.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Site Based Maintenance Electrician." The description emphasizes maintenance, repair, fault finding, testing, and installation related to electrical systems within a facilities management context.  The required qualifications include specific electrical certifications (C&G 2365, C&G 2357, C&G 2382 18th Edition) indicating a skilled trade role.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **7411 (Building and related electricians):** This is a strong match. The job description aligns well with the tasks described for this unit, such as installing, maintaining, and repairing electrical wiring systems and related equipment in buildings. The job title "Site Based Maintenance Electrician" also directly corresponds.
    * **7412 (Electrical mechanics and fitters):** While there might be some overlap in tasks, this unit focuses more on machinery and apparatus, whereas the advertisement emphasizes building systems.  The required certifications in the job ad are more aligned with building electrician work than machinery.
    * **3113 (Electrical engineering technicians):** This unit involves technical tasks aiding in research, design, and operation of electrical systems. The job advertisement focuses on practical, hands-on maintenance and repair, not engineering or technical assistance in research and development.
    * **3114 (Electronics engineering technicians):** This is not a match, as the job ad is specifically for electrical work, not electronics.
    * **3155 (Air traffic safety electronics technicians):** This is clearly not relevant to the job advertisement.
    * **7127 (Air conditioning and refrigeration mechanics):** This is not relevant to the job advertisement.
    * **2151 (Electrical engineers):** This unit requires a higher level of education and focuses on design and research, not hands-on maintenance and repair as described in the job ad.
    * **8212 (Electrical and electronic equipment assemblers):** This unit focuses on assembly work, not the maintenance and repair described in the job ad.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    ISCO Code (unit): 7411
    ISCO Title: Building and related electricians
    Confidence: 1.0
    Reasoning: The job duties, required qualifications, and job title align perfectly with the description of ISCO unit 7411.  The job is explicitly about building-based electrical maintenance and installation.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The job title is "Investment Analyst." This immediately points towards ISCO 2413 (Financial Analyst) as a strong potential match.

2. **Review the job description:** The description emphasizes market research, financial modeling, valuation analysis, preparing transaction deliverables, and supporting fund managers in investment decisions. These tasks align strongly with the tasks described for ISCO 2413.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires strong analytical skills, attention to detail, experience in real estate investment, advanced Excel and PowerPoint skills, and excellent communication skills. These are all common requirements for financial analysts (ISCO 2413).

4. **Evaluate the ISCO 2413 definition:** "Financial analysts conduct quantitative analyses of information affecting investment programmes of public or private institutions." This definition perfectly encapsulates the core function described in the job ad.

5. **Compare with other potential ISCO units:** While other ISCO units like 2412 (Financial and investment advisers) might seem relevant at first glance, the job ad focuses on analyzing investment opportunities within a company, rather than advising external clients.  ISCO 3311 (Securities and finance dealers and brokers) involves buying and selling securities, which is not the primary focus of this role. The other provided ISCO units are even less relevant based on their descriptions.

ISCO Code: 2413
ISCO Title: Financial Analyst
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, required skills, and responsibilities align perfectly with the definition and tasks of a Financial Analyst (ISCO 2413). The job focuses on in-house analysis of real estate investment opportunities, financial modeling, and supporting fund managers, rather than advising external clients or buying/selling securities.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Trainee Butchers," and the description emphasizes handling, cutting, de-boning, trimming, and de-skinning pork products.  The role involves working in a chilled food environment and adhering to safety and operational procedures.  It's a trainee position, suggesting a lower skill level initially, with opportunities for growth.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **7511 (Butchers, Fishmongers and related food preparers):** This is a strong match. The job description explicitly mentions butchery tasks like cutting, de-boning, and trimming meat.  Although it's a trainee role, the core tasks align perfectly with this ISCO unit.
    * **Other ISCO Units:** The remaining ISCO units are not relevant.  They pertain to animal care (5164), poultry farming (6122), dairy production (7513), wood treatment (7521), fur and leather preparation (7535 and 8155), general food processing (8160), livestock farm labor (9212), and fast food preparation (9411). None of these align with the core tasks of a butcher.

3. **Final Prediction:**

    * **ISCO Code:** 7511
    * **ISCO Title:** Butchers, Fishmongers and related food preparers
    * **Confidence:** 1.0
    * **Reasoning:** The job description clearly outlines the duties of a butcher, focusing on meat preparation tasks. While the "trainee" aspect suggests a lower skill level, the core responsibilities fall squarely within the scope of ISCO 7511.
    * **Alternative ISCO Codes:** 8160, 9411, 5120 (Cooks).  These are provided as fallback options if a strict interpretation of "trainee" disqualifies 7511 due to the implied skill level. 8160 (Food and related products machine operators) could be relevant if the trainee uses machinery extensively. 9411 (Fast food preparers) and 5120 (Cooks) are less relevant but could be considered if the focus shifts significantly towards preparing ready-to-eat meat dishes rather than raw meat processing.

The company offers: Attractive benefits package, Pleasant working environment, Accommodation and meals.

2. **Matching with Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **5132: Bartenders:** This is the most relevant unit based on the job title and description. The required tasks align perfectly with the bartender's duties, such as preparing and serving drinks, managing the bar area, and handling payments.  The experience requirement also suggests a standard bartender role rather than a managerial one.

3. **Eliminating Other Options:**
    * **1411: Hotel Managers:** While the job is in a hotel setting, the advertisement explicitly seeks a "Barman."  The description doesn't include managerial responsibilities like overseeing staff, budgeting, or planning hotel operations.
    * **1412: Restaurant Managers:** Similar to the hotel manager role, this involves broader management responsibilities not mentioned in the ad.
    * **1431: Sports, recreation and cultural centre managers:**  This is entirely unrelated to the job advertised.
    * **2652: Musicians, singers and composers:**  While some bars may have live music, this is not the primary focus of the advertisement.
    * **3435: Artistic and cultural associate professionals:**  This is also unrelated.
    * **5131: Waiters:** While there might be some overlap in serving customers, the core responsibility is bartending.
    * **5246: Food service counter attendants:** This involves food preparation and counter service, not drink preparation at a bar.
    * **7511: Butchers, fishmongers and related food preparers:**  Completely unrelated.
    * **8160: Food and related products machine operators:**  Also unrelated.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 5132
ISCO Title: Bartenders
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, required experience, and tasks align perfectly with the definition of a bartender.  The job is located within a hotel/camping setting, but the role is specifically for a barman, not a manager.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Job Title and Description Analysis:** The job title is "Security Guard" (Охранител). The description mentions guarding a business building in a specific district of Sofia during night shifts. This aligns strongly with security-related roles.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The primary responsibility is guarding a business building. This likely includes patrolling, monitoring access, and ensuring the security of the premises.

3. **Required Skills and Qualifications:** The advertisement explicitly states it is suitable for candidates with little or no experience. This suggests the role doesn't require advanced training or specific qualifications.

4. **Major, Sub-major, and Minor Groups:**  Given the security nature of the job, Major Group 5 (Services and Sales Workers) appears most relevant. Within this group, Sub-major 54 (Protective Services Workers) is a direct match.

5. **ISCO Unit Comparison:**
    * **5414 (Security Guards):** This unit's description of patrolling premises, controlling access, and maintaining order aligns perfectly with the job advertisement.  The inclusion of "Security Guard" in the list of example occupations further strengthens this match.

6. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 5414
ISCO Title: Security Guards
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, and responsibilities align perfectly with the definition and tasks described for ISCO unit 5414 (Security Guards). The requirement for little to no experience also fits the general skill level associated with this unit.
Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.  The provided 5414 is a perfect match, making alternatives unnecessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The Hungarian job title "TARGONCAVEZETŐ RAKTÁROS" translates to "Forklift Operator Warehouse Worker". This suggests a role involving both forklift operation and general warehouse duties.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The job description lists tasks such as manual and machine material handling, goods receipt and dispatch, documentation, PDA usage for recording, inventory participation, and loading/unloading vehicles with a forklift.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires a minimum of elementary education, a valid forklift license, experience with the specific forklift type, teamwork ability, precision, good communication, responsibility, flexibility with overtime, and a positive attitude.  Truck loading experience is advantageous.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The most relevant provided ISCO unit appears to be 8344 (Lifting-truck operators), which falls under Major group 8 (Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers), Sub-major group 83 (Drivers and Mobile Plant Operators).

5. **Step-by-step reasoning:**
    * **8344 (Lifting-truck operators):** This is the closest match. The primary duty is forklift operation, aligning with the job title and description.  The tasks of loading/unloading and moving goods within the warehouse using a forklift are central to this ISCO unit.
    * **Other provided ISCO units:** While the job involves warehouse work, it's not primarily focused on stock keeping (4321), transport coordination (4323), heavy truck driving (8332), crane operation (8343), hand/pedal vehicle operation (9331), freight handling (9333), shelf filling (9334), or messenger/porter duties (9621).  These ISCO units don't encompass the core responsibilities of this advertised role.

ISCO Code: 8344
ISCO Title: Lifting-truck operators
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description emphasizes forklift operation as the core duty, aligning perfectly with ISCO 8344.  Additional warehouse tasks are secondary to the forklift operation.
Alternative ISCO Codes: 9333, 4321, 8332

Job Ad ID: 738591312, Row: 25352, Pred: 2359, 2341, 2354, 2353, 2330, 2355, 2352, 5312, 2310, 2320
Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The advertisement is for a Tutor to work with disadvantaged year 5 and 6 students in English and Maths.  The role emphasizes improving student performance and requires a teaching qualification (QTS/PGCE).  It involves individual and small group support.  This suggests a focused, targeted teaching role rather than general classroom instruction.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **2310 - University and higher education teachers:** This is clearly not a match, as the role is in a primary school setting.
    * **2320 - Vocational education teachers:**  While the role aims to improve student skills, it's focused on core subjects (English and Maths) at a primary level, not vocational training.  Therefore, this is not a suitable match.
    * **2330 - Secondary education teachers:** The students are year 5 and 6, which falls within primary education, not secondary.  This is not a match.
    * **2341 - Primary school teachers:** This is closer, but the role is specifically described as a *Tutor*, suggesting a more specialized, targeted intervention rather than general primary school teaching.  The ad also emphasizes flexible hours, indicating it may not be a standard teaching position.
    * **2352 - Special needs teachers:** While the students are described as "disadvantaged," the ad doesn't specify that they have special educational needs requiring specialized instruction.  This might be a possibility if more information were available, but based on the current information, it's not the best fit.
    * **2353 - Other language teachers:** The focus is on English and Maths, not language teaching for non-native speakers.  This is not a match.
    * **2354 - Other music teachers:**  Not applicable, as the subject matter is not music.
    * **2355 - Other arts teachers:** Not applicable, as the subject matter is not arts-related.
    * **2359 - Other teaching professionals:** This is the most appropriate category.  The role involves private or small group tuition in core subjects, fitting the description of "private tuition in subjects other than foreign languages and the arts."  The focus on targeted intervention for disadvantaged students aligns with the broader scope of this category.
    * **5312 - Teachers' aides:** This is not a suitable match. The role requires a teaching qualification and involves direct instruction, whereas teacher aides typically assist with non-teaching duties.

3. **Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2359
ISCO Title: Other teaching professionals
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: The role involves targeted tutoring in core subjects (English and Maths) for disadvantaged primary school students, outside of regular classroom teaching.  This aligns with the description of ISCO 2359, which encompasses private tuition and other teaching roles not classified elsewhere.

Job Ad ID: 874368285, Row: 25351, Pred: 2643, 2353, 9111, 3333, 3412, 9622, 5243, 2423, 3221, 4414
Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Polish Freelance Interpreter," and the description emphasizes interpreting between Polish and English in various settings like social services, medical appointments, and legal matters. This aligns strongly with the ISCO unit 2643 (Translators, interpreters and other linguists).

2. **Evaluate main responsibilities and tasks:** The core tasks involve oral interpretation, ensuring accurate communication between parties. This matches the description of interpreters within ISCO 2643.  "Interpreting from a spoken or a signed language into another spoken or signed language, in particular at conferences, meetings and similar occasions, and ensuring that the correct meaning and, as far as possible, the spirit of the original are transmitted."

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:**  Fluency in Polish and English is essential.  While formal qualifications like DPSI or NRPSI are preferred, they aren't mandatory, suggesting the role could accommodate varying experience levels within ISCO 2643.  The ad also mentions language assessment tests, further reinforcing the focus on linguistic skills.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 2643 falls under Major group 2 (Professionals), Sub-major group 26 (Legal, Social and Cultural Professionals). This is a fitting categorization given the interpreter's role in facilitating communication in potentially sensitive situations within legal, social, and cultural contexts.

ISCO Code: 2643
ISCO Title: Translators, interpreters and other linguists
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description explicitly focuses on interpretation tasks, aligning perfectly with the definition and tasks outlined in ISCO 2643. The required skills and qualifications further reinforce this classification.
Alternative ISCO Codes:  None.  The provided ISCO unit 2643 is a precise match, negating the need for alternatives.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "IT Manager." The description emphasizes managing all aspects of IT, telephony, mobile, and associated technologies.  This aligns strongly with the ISCO unit 1330: Information and communications technology services managers.

2. **Main responsibilities and tasks:** The job ad lists responsibilities such as managing IT teams (service desk, developers), driving continuous improvement, implementing new technologies, and managing specific systems (cloud, Microsoft 365). These tasks directly correspond to the tasks described in ISCO 1330.

3. **Required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires experience managing IT teams, a track record of leading IT development, and solid experience with various hardware and software systems.  These skills align with the high skill level (level 3) associated with ISCO 1330.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** ISCO 1330 falls under Major group 1 (Managers), Sub-major group 13 (Production and Specialized Services Managers).  This classification accurately reflects the managerial nature of the role and its focus on specialized IT services.  The provided ISCO 1219 (Business services and administration managers) is less relevant as the job is specifically focused on IT, not general business administration.  Similarly, the other provided ISCO units (1223, 1439, 2356, 2522, 3511, 3512, 2434, 2522) are less relevant because they focus on research and development, general services management, training, sales, systems administration, ICT operations, user support, and installation/servicing, respectively, rather than the overall management of IT services.

ISCO Code (unit): 1330
ISCO Title: Information and communications technology services managers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title, description, responsibilities, required skills, and major/sub-major group classifications all align perfectly with ISCO 1330. The job specifically focuses on managing IT services, which is the core definition of this ISCO unit.
Alternative ISCO Codes (unit):  None.  The provided 1330 is a perfect match, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Job Ad ID: 779258170, Row: 25349, Pred: 2330, 2341, 2359, 2353, 2352, 2354, 2355, 3314, 2320, 2120
Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title "Učiteľ/ka ZŠ (2. stupeň) - matematika" translates to "Teacher - Elementary School (2nd level) - Mathematics".  The 2nd level in Slovak elementary schools typically corresponds to grades 5-9, which is equivalent to lower secondary education in some systems. The advertisement specifies that the position is for a mathematics teacher at this level.  The description emphasizes teaching responsibilities, use of digital tools (Google Meet, Classroom, etc.), and software like Word and Excel, alongside mathematical and geometrical applications.  The requirement of a second-level university degree (equivalent to a Master's degree) is also noted.

2. **Evaluating ISCO 2120 (Mathematicians, Actuaries, and Statisticians):** This is immediately ruled out. The job is for a teacher, not a researcher or applied mathematician.  The tasks described in the ISCO unit focus on research, development, and application of mathematical principles, not teaching.

3. **Evaluating ISCO 2320 (Vocational Education Teachers):** This is also not a good fit.  While the ad mentions the use of some computer applications, the core role is teaching mathematics, a general academic subject, not a specific vocational skill.  The ISCO description explicitly excludes teachers of general subjects like mathematics.

4. **Evaluating ISCO 2330 (Secondary Education Teachers):** This is the most appropriate ISCO unit. The job title and description clearly indicate a teaching role at the lower secondary level (2nd level of elementary school, grades 5-9). The tasks described in the ISCO unit, such as lesson planning, instruction, assessment, and parent communication, align perfectly with the advertised position. The note within the ISCO 2330 description specifically addresses the classification of mathematics teachers at this level, even if they are within a school that might also offer vocational training.

5. **Evaluating ISCO 2341 (Primary School Teachers):** This is incorrect. The job explicitly states "2. stupeň" (2nd level), which is not primary school.

6. **Evaluating ISCO 2352 (Special Needs Teachers):**  There is no indication in the advertisement that the role involves teaching students with special needs.

7. **Evaluating ISCO 2353 (Other Language Teachers):** The advertisement focuses solely on teaching mathematics, not languages.

8. **Evaluating ISCO 2354 (Other Music Teachers):**  The subject is mathematics, not music.

9. **Evaluating ISCO 2359 (Other Teaching Professionals):** While this is a broader category, ISCO 2330 (Secondary Education Teachers) is a more specific and accurate match.  The job advertisement doesn't describe tutoring or counselling, the primary functions listed in ISCO 2359.

10. **Evaluating ISCO 3314 (Statistical, Mathematical, and Related Associate Professionals):** This is not a teaching role. This unit group describes assistant roles supporting statisticians and mathematicians.


**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 2330
ISCO Title: Secondary Education Teachers
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job advertisement explicitly describes a mathematics teaching position at the lower secondary level (2nd level of elementary school, grades 5-9). This aligns perfectly with the definition and tasks described for ISCO 2330.

Alternative ISCO Codes: 2359, 2320, 2341 (in descending order of potential relevance, though 2330 is clearly the best fit).

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Restaurant Service Staff." The description emphasizes customer service, taking orders, serving, collaborating with kitchen/bar staff, problem-solving, billing, and payments.  This aligns strongly with waiter/waitress duties.

2. **Compare with provided ISCO unit descriptions:**
    * **5131: Waiters:** This unit's description closely matches the job ad's responsibilities, including taking orders, serving, clearing tables, and handling payments.
    * **Other ISCO units:** While other units like 1412 (Restaurant Managers), 3434 (Chefs), 5120 (Cooks), 5132 (Bartenders), etc., involve some aspects of the job, they don't encompass the primary focus on customer service and order fulfillment.

3. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad mentions fluency in Portuguese and English, the ability to work independently and in a team, and thriving in a fast-paced environment. These are typical requirements for waitstaff.

4. **Major, sub-major, and minor groups:** The most relevant major group is "Services and Sales Workers," with the sub-major group "Personal Services Workers" fitting perfectly.  ISCO 5131 falls under these categories.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code: 5131
ISCO Title: Waiters
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job description focuses on serving customers, taking orders, handling payments, and collaborating with kitchen staff, all core duties of a Waiter (ISCO 5131).  The required skills and the job's context within a restaurant further solidify this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the Job Advertisement:** The job title is "Telemarketer," and the description clearly states the individual will conduct telephone interviews to contact existing and new customers, collect information, and achieve business plan commitments. This strongly suggests a sales-oriented role.

2. **Evaluate Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **5244 - Contact centre salespersons:** This unit perfectly aligns with the job description.  The tasks listed in the ISCO description, such as promoting goods/services by phone, seeking sales, and updating marketing databases, directly match the telemarketer's responsibilities. The examples include "Telemarketer" and "Telemarketing salesperson."

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
    * The job title "Telemarketer" is explicitly mentioned in ISCO unit 5244.
    * The job description focuses on contacting customers via telephone for sales and information gathering, aligning with the core duties of a contact centre salesperson.
    * The goal of achieving business plan commitments and growth objectives indicates a sales-driven role.

4. **Final Prediction:**
    ISCO Code: 5244
    ISCO Title: Contact centre salespersons
    Confidence: 1.0
    Reasoning: The job title and description directly match the definition and tasks of a contact centre salesperson (ISCO 5244), focusing on telephone-based sales and customer contact.

    Alternative ISCO Codes:  N/A -  The primary match is highly confident, so alternatives are not necessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title and description:** The job title is "Plumber (Gas Safe Registered)." The description emphasizes gas safety registration, remedial and reactive works, and working on domestic developments.

2. **Review ISCO 7126 (Plumbers and Pipe Fitters):** This unit's description explicitly mentions "Plumbers and pipe fitters assemble, install, repair and maintain pipe systems... for water, gas, drainage..." and tasks include installing gas appliances.  The required "Gas Safe Registered" qualification strongly aligns with gas fitting duties.

3. **Consider other ISCO units:** While other provided ISCO units relate to construction, none mention gas work or safety certifications. ISCO 7127 (Air conditioning and refrigeration mechanics) is related but distinct, focusing on cooling systems rather than gas and water supply.  ISCO 7111 (House builders) may subcontract plumbing but doesn't perform the specialized work itself.  The remaining ISCO units are even less relevant.

4. **Conclusion:** ISCO 7126 aligns perfectly with the job title, required certification, and described duties.

ISCO Code: 7126
ISCO Title: Plumbers and Pipe Fitters
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job title explicitly states "Plumber (Gas Safe Registered)," and the description focuses on tasks directly related to plumbing and gas fitting, aligning perfectly with ISCO 7126's definition and listed tasks.  The "Gas Safe Registered" requirement further reinforces this classification.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The job title is "Receptionist." This immediately points towards ISCO unit 4224 (Hotel receptionist) and 4226 (Receptionist (general)).

2. **Analyze the job description:** The description emphasizes hotel-specific tasks like managing reservations, check-in/check-out procedures, handling guest requests, and coordinating with housekeeping.  This aligns strongly with ISCO unit 4224 (Hotel receptionist).

3. **Compare responsibilities and tasks:** The tasks listed in the job ad (reservations, check-in/out, guest requests, billing) are almost identical to the tasks described for ISCO unit 4224 (Hotel receptionist).  While some general receptionist duties are present, the core responsibilities are clearly within the hotel context.

4. **Consider required skills and qualifications:** The ad requires hospitality experience, hotel school education (preferred), language skills, and experience with hotel management software (Opera). These qualifications reinforce the suitability of ISCO unit 4224.

5. **Evaluate ISCO 4226 (Receptionist (general)):** While the job title "Receptionist" could fall under this category, the job description's focus on hotel-specific tasks makes 4224 a much better fit.  A general receptionist typically works in a broader office setting, not specifically within the hospitality industry.

6. **Consider other provided ISCO units:** None of the other provided ISCO units align with the job description.  For example, 1411 (Hotel manager) involves higher-level management responsibilities, while 4221 (Travel consultant) focuses on travel arrangements rather than hotel reception.

**ISCO Code (unit):** 4224
**ISCO Title:** Hotel receptionist
**Confidence:** 1.0
**Reasoning:** The job description clearly outlines responsibilities specific to a hotel receptionist, including managing reservations, check-in/out, guest requests, and billing.  The required skills and qualifications further solidify this classification.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement and the provided ISCO units:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job advertisement is in Spanish and translates to:
    * Title: Construction Workers/Builders
    * Description: Construction Workers/Builders. Public Employment Service of Galicia, Ames, A Coruña province. Apply on the website.  First or Second Official. Driver's License required.

2. **Analysis of the Job Title and Description:** The title "Albañiles" translates to "Construction Workers" or "Builders," suggesting a general construction role. The description mentions "Oficial de Primera O de Segunda" which translates to "First or Second Official," implying a skilled worker, not a laborer. The requirement of a driver's license suggests some level of mobility and potentially transporting materials or equipment.

3. **Comparison with Potential ISCO Units:**
    * **7111 (House builders):** While the title "builders" might initially suggest this category, the advertisement lacks specifics about house building.  It's too general to confidently assign this code.
    * **7112 (Bricklayers and related workers):** This is a strong possibility.  "Albañiles" often specifically refers to bricklaying in some contexts.  The general nature of the ad doesn't rule this out.
    * **7113 (Stonemasons, stone cutters…):**  This is less likely given the general nature of the advertisement.  There's no mention of stonework specifically.
    * **7114 (Concrete placers, concrete finishers…):**  Similar to stonemasons, this is too specific and not supported by the advertisement's text.
    * **7119 (Building frame and related trades workers not elsewhere classified):** This is a possibility due to the general nature of the ad. However, it's less specific than 7112, which seems more directly related to the term "Albañiles."
    * **7121 (Roofers):**  No mention of roofing work is made in the advertisement.
    * **7123 (Plasterers):**  No mention of plastering work is made in the advertisement.
    * **9312 (Civil engineering labourers):**  The "Official" designation in the advertisement suggests a skilled trade, not a laborer role.
    * **9313 (Building construction labourers):**  Again, the "Official" designation suggests a skilled trade, making this less likely.
    * **9622 (Odd-job persons):**  This is clearly not a fit, as the ad specifies a construction-related role.

4. **Reasoning and Final Prediction:** The term "Albañiles" most commonly refers to bricklayers, although it can be used more generally.  The "Official" designation suggests a skilled worker.  Given the available information, 7112 is the most likely fit, although the general nature of the advertisement leaves some uncertainty.

ISCO Code: 7112
ISCO Title: Bricklayers and related workers
Confidence: 0.7
Reasoning: "Albañiles" frequently translates to bricklayer, and the "Official" designation suggests a skilled worker within the construction trades. The lack of specific details in the advertisement leaves some room for other interpretations.

Response:
Here's a step-by-step analysis of the job advertisement to determine the appropriate ISCO unit:

1. **Translation and Interpretation:** The job title "Underläkare" translates to "Junior Doctor" or "Resident Physician."  The description indicates this is a role in primary care within the Umeå region of Sweden.  The job involves handling a variety of patient cases under the guidance of experienced physicians.

2. **Responsibilities and Tasks:** The advertisement emphasizes gaining experience in primary care and general medicine. The Junior Doctor will have their own patient consultations but with readily available support from senior doctors. This suggests a level of autonomy balanced with supervision.  The tasks align with core primary care duties: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

3. **Skills and Qualifications:** The position requires a licensed physician or someone about to receive their license.  Experience in primary care is preferred but not mandatory.  The desired qualities include a positive attitude, patient-centered approach, teamwork skills, and the ability to work independently.

4. **ISCO Unit Analysis:**

* **2211 (Generalist medical practitioners):** This is a strong match. The job focuses on primary care/general medicine, aligning perfectly with this unit's description. The requirement of being a licensed physician or soon-to-be licensed also fits the qualification level for this unit. The supervised autonomy described in the ad aligns with the description of medical interns/residents included in this category.

* **2212 (Specialist medical practitioners):** While the ad mentions working within the "specialist area" of general medicine, the overall context points to a broad primary care role, not a specialized one.  This unit is less suitable.

* **2230 (Traditional and complementary medicine professionals):**  The advertisement makes no mention of traditional or complementary medicine. This unit is irrelevant.

* **2240 (Paramedical practitioners):** This unit involves providing medical services "more limited in scope and complexity than those carried out by medical doctors."  Since the advertised role requires a physician's license, this unit is not appropriate.

* **3221 (Nursing associate professionals):** This unit is clearly for nursing support roles, not licensed physicians.  It's not a match.

* **3222 (Midwifery associate professionals):** This unit focuses on pregnancy and childbirth, not general primary care. It's irrelevant to this job ad.

* **3230 (Traditional and complementary medicine associate professionals):**  As with ISCO 2230, this unit is irrelevant due to the lack of focus on traditional/complementary medicine.

* **3256 (Medical assistants):** This unit describes support staff working under the direct supervision of physicians. The advertised role has a higher level of responsibility and autonomy than a medical assistant.

* **3344 (Medical secretaries):** This is an administrative role and not a match for a physician position.

* **5321 (Health care assistants):** This unit is for personal care assistants, not medical professionals.  It's not relevant.

**Final Prediction:**

ISCO Code (unit): 2211
ISCO Title: Generalist medical practitioners
Confidence: 1.0
Reasoning: The job directly involves primary care/general medicine, requires a physician's license (or imminent licensure), and describes a level of supervised autonomy typical for junior doctors gaining experience in general practice.  This aligns perfectly with the description and requirements of ISCO unit 2211.

Alternative ISCO Codes (unit): None.  2211 is a perfect fit, making alternative suggestions unnecessary.

Response:
1. **Analyze the job title:** The title "Primary School Teacher" directly matches the example occupation and similar job titles provided for ISCO unit 2341: Primary School Teachers.

2. **Analyze the job description:** The description mentions "KS1 KS2," which are Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 in the UK primary school system. This further reinforces the match with ISCO 2341.  The description also emphasizes experience with the UK curriculum, which is a core requirement for primary school teachers.
